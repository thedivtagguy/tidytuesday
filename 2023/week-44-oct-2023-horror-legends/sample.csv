Getting the Strap,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/getting-the-strap/,false,Women beheaded by purse snatchers?,Barbara Mikkelson,2000-11-03,Women who wear their purses strapped across their bodies running the risk of being beheaded by purse snatchers.,"Claim: Women who wear their purses strapped across their bodies running the risk of being beheaded by purse snatchers. Status: False. Example: [Collected on the Internet, 2000]  I just saw a segment of ""Oprah"" reporting on the deaths of at least 14 women in the United States due to broken necks from usually harmless purse snatching!! Women who wear their purse straps across their chests rather than over their shoulders are at risk for broken necks and, possibly, decapitation!! Purse snatchers' usual method of operation involves approaching an unsuspecting woman, quickly pulling her purse from her shoulder, and fleeing the scene. Purse snatchers do not check to see if the purse is around the woman's neck first!! Purse straps will not break, your neck most likely will! Fourteen women have already died!! Beware!!! The first reported case of a purse strap-related death occurred in Los Angeles in 1987. A young woman was leaving a local mall when a man mistakenly broke her neck in an attempt to steal her purse, which was holding a measly $20!!!!! X-rays revealed the woman's neck was nearly severed in two! Another woman in 1988 suffered not only a twice fractured neck bone, but a completely shattered jaw! One woman survived this grisly ordeal only to be left quadriplegic for life!! The scariest news is that with purse snatching on the rise, 6 cases were reported just over the past year!!! Remember this: more purse snatchings are reported during Christmas time than any other season. Please tell your mothers, daughters, sisters, and friends: DO NOT WEAR YOUR PURSE STRAP ACROSS YOUR CHEST!
 Origins: This advisory  appeared on the Internet in November 2000. Despite the unsigned e-mail's claim that The Oprah Winfrey Show recently aired a segment about purse-snatching deaths, the show's transcription service does not list any episode in the year prior to the e-mail even remotely matching this description. Once again, a baseless bit of rumormongering had been bolstered by specious claims that the writer had gained his information from a popular TV talk show and was now passing it along as a public service. In effect, Oprah's hard-won credibility was used to prop up someone else's baloney. Purse-snatching fatalities have occurred, but not because victims were wearing bags strapped across their bodies and thus were choked to death or decapitated by the straps. The few such fatalities on record involved victims who either would not or could not let go of the bag and were knocked down and dragged by the thieves trying to pry it loose, or who were hit by their assailants. The fatalities described in this ""Warning To Women!"" look to have been invented to make gals act on the advice being offered: ""Don't strap your purse across your body."" Claims that ""The first reported case of a purse strap-related death occurred in Los Angeles in 1987"" and ""deaths of at least 14 women in the United States due to broken necks"" just don't hold up upon examination. Likewise, any woman who's ever owned a handbag knows ""Purse straps will not break"" just isn't true. (Our favorite howler: ""X-rays revealed the woman's neck was nearly severed in two!"" Even in Los Angeles, medical staff are capable of recognizing this condition without the benefit of x-rays.) Though the details of the alert are clearly false, the advice being offered is actually worthwhile. Purse snatchers from the ""grab and go"" school have injured victims when those being robbed couldn't quickly get loose from their handbags. A gal who wears her purse strapped across her runs the risk of being dragged along as the thief tries to get away with the booty. Serious injuries and even deaths have occurred from such draggings. If your purse is being snatched, let it go. Whatever's in there is not worth being hurt over. Better still, a variety of law enforcement agencies offer the following tips on how to avoid becoming the victim of a pickpocket or purse snatcher:             DON'TS:        Barbara ""loose me from this guy and diamonds"" Mikkelson Last updated: 28 July 2006

Granny on the Roof Rack,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/my-mother-the-cargo/,legend,Did a car thief steal an automobile with a dead body in it?,Barbara Mikkelson,2000-12-17,"An old woman traveling in a car filled with relatives dies during a long journey. The surviving family members place her corpse on the car's roof rack, cover it with a tarp, and continue on. Upon reaching the nearest town, the family stops for a coffee and something to eat, leaving Granny's remains tied to the roof rack.

The surviving family members place her corpse on the car's roof rack, cover it with a tarp, and continue on. Upon reaching the nearest town, the family stops for a coffee and something to eat, leaving Granny's remains tied to the roof rack. They return to the parking lot to find their vehicle — and their dead relative — gone. LEGEND Examples:  This story was told me by my cousin, who had heard it from a friend in Leeds, about a couple whom he knew, who went for a camping holiday in Spain with their car. They had taken his stepmother with them. She slept in a different tent to the others. On the morning that they struck [broke camp], they were very busy, and they didn't hear anything of her for a while, and then, when they went to her tent, they found she had died, and rigor had already set in. They were in a great state, and they didn't know what to do, but they decided to roll her up in the tent, and put her on top of the car, and go to the nearest town, and go to the consul and the police. So they did this, and went to the town, and then they felt very cold and miserable, and they hadn't had a proper breakfast. So they thought they'd get a cup of coffee to revive them, before they went in search of the consul. So they parked the car, and went to a small cafe, and had their cup of coffee, and then came back to look for the car. But it wasn't there. It had gone. So they went home to England without the car or the stepmother. But the difficulty was, they couldn't prove [probate] her will.
 
 [Emrich, 1972] It happened to a family friend as they were traveling across the desert to California. Within this station wagon there was a father, a mother and their children, and the mother-in-law who everyone called ""Grandma."" And as they were going across the desert Grandma became sick and she died. Now they didn't want to alarm the children and they didn't want to leave Grandma out in the desert so the only place they had room for her where she — her smell wouldn't bother the children — was to strap her on top of the station wagon along with the baggage with a tarp over her, of course. And as they were traveling across the desert they kept looking for a town where they could deposit Grandma. They finally arrived in a small town in Arizona where they stopped at a filling station and they went in to report Grandma's death. And while they were within the filling station somebody stole the station wagon and when they went out — no station wagon and no Grandma! Well, it wasn't very funny even though it sounds like it because they have to wait seven years now to prove that Grandma is dead before they can collect any insurance. And they've never been able to find either the car or Grandma. This actually happened. They couldn't leave Grandma out in the desert. Not only because — uh — it wasn't right to leave a body out in the desert but also for insurance and also to prove it wasn't murder and also to prove there was a body in any court proceedings.
 
 [Healey and Glanvill, 1996] There was a family from Surrey who decided to spend their vacation in France, taking their elderly grandma with them. Granny spent all their stay complaining. Well, not quite all of it, because a little way into the holiday, she died on them. Deciding that the old woman would hate not to be buried in her beloved Blighty, the family set about returning her home, and, mindful of the customs and other problems they might face, they resolved to hide her. So they bought a cheap bit of carpet, and rolled the wrinkled little corpse up in it. Granny's body was by now too stiff to bend on to a car seat, so they had to strap her on the roof-rack. In this way she was driven across France for two days, through driving rain and baking sunshine, across the Channel by ferry, and finally all the way home. Unhappily, having made it back without a hitch, the family were devastated when, after a well-earned cuppa, they went outside to find the car stolen — carpet, Granny and all. And they were never recovered.  Variations:   tensions involved in crossing international borders, while North American renditions rarely mention borders at all. The primary focus in American tales is the inconvenience of dear old gran's death.     happened. European renditions generally end with the family's discovery of the theft, a detail possibly related to why the body is being transported in the first place (usually out of filial desire to do right by the departed by bringing her home for proper burial). North American tellings, however, often end with the realization that inability to produce the body will lead to difficulty collecting the inheritance. In those versions, the corpse was being carted around the countryside usually only out of desire to dump it at the first appropriate spot. Unlike the dead cat in the package legend, scant thought is given in this story to the thief's projected reaction upon discovering what he made off with. The focus stays upon the family's woes, first in having to transport the corpse, then in having to explain the theft to the authorities. Folklorists have advanced differing theories about what lies at the heart of this legend: fear of the dead (without a proper burial, Granny may return to haunt her offspring), disgust with the elderly (at least now she's not sitting in the car), and distrust of authorities (fear of customs and border officials). It might be much simpler than all that. Throughout the legend's numerous tellings, Granny is never once portrayed as loved and valued, someone whose loss is felt and indeed mourned. Those left to cope with her death treat her as a non-person — their major concern becomes what to do with the decaying body, not how to come to terms with the passing of someone deeply cared about. There's no sense of tears being shed; it's all bundle up the body and get rid of it. Even in the odd telling where mention is made of the family being thrown into a great state by the discovery of Granny's demise, the focus is on their shock at happening upon a death and having to deal with the question of what to do with a corpse, not upon their grief over the loss of a family member. Figuratively a burden to the family during her life, Granny becomes a literal burden in death. Once deceased, she is dealt with in a manner reflective of how nuclear families often deal with their elderly — she's distanced from the vital center of the family and stashed out of sight. In reality, aging parents might be consigned to an old folks home wherein they receive a once-a-month duty call; in legend, the ""burden"" is packaged up for neat disposal and placed among the other baggage. The twist at the end of the North American versions becomes stunningly appropriate under that analysis — the theft of the body causes a delay in the probate of Granny's will. Only a body to them in death, Granny has her revenge upon her cold-hearted relatives — the lack of that very body keeps them from inheriting what they thought should by rights pass to them.

Origins: 
While we can establish that the car in question does now indeed reside in a Viennese museum, no other part of the tale has been confirmed. Its resemblance to another ""death car"" story — one involving the Porsche Spyder James Dean was killed in gives us pause, though. [Blundell & Hall, 1988] Of all things jinxed, few can have bestowed more misery than a motor car owned by the Hapsburg dynasty of imperial Austria. The open-topped limousine was given to the Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the troubled throne. He rode in it in July 1914 on a state visit to Sarajevo. Sarajevo then was in Bosnia and Herzegovina, a state recently annexed by the imperial court of Vienna. In the car with the Archduke on this ill-fated day were his wife, General Potiorek of the Austrian army and three other dignitaries, plus a driver. A fervent young nationalist called Gavrilo Princip stepped in front of the vehicle on its official tour of the city and shot the Archduke and his wife, the Archduchess Sophie. More catastrophic still, this event was to trigger the First World War. General Potiorek became the next owner of the car. Several weeks into the war his armies suffered a rout at the hands of the ill-organised army of Serbia. The General was summoned back to Vienna by the Emperor Franz Josef I. And there in Vienna, his reputation ruined, his sanity destroyed, he died. [Another version adds the detail of Potiorek becoming an impoverished lunatic who eventually died in the almshouse.] A captain of Potiorek's staff took charge of the jinxed vehicle; nine days later in a terrible accident he killed two peasants on the road before swerving into a tree and killing himself. After the war, the governor of newly independent Yugoslavia took charge of the car. He endured a succession of terrible accidents, one of which cost him his left arm. [Four accidents in four months, according to another source.] The car was then sold to a doctor, who was crushed to death when he overturned it into a ditch. [He had the car six months before it ""turned"" on him.] The next owner was Simon Mantharides, a diamond dealer. He fell to his death from a precipice. [The other version gives a slightly different sequence of events. According to it, the car passed from the crushed doctor to a wealthy unnamed jeweler who enjoyed it for all of a year before committing suicide. Its next owner was yet another doctor, one whose patients deserted him out of fear for his cursed car.] The car passed into the hands of a Swiss racing driver who was later killed in an accident in it. [Thrown over a stone wall to his death, says another source.] A Serbian farmer, who paid a fantastic sum for the car which had acquired great historical value, was the next owner and victim. He cadged a tow from a horse and cart one morning because the engine would not turn over. He forgot to switch off the ignition and the engine caught suddenly. The car lurched forward into the horse and cart, and overturned, killing the farmer. Finally, a garage owner lost his life in the car returning from a wedding. He tried to overtake a long line of vehicles and was killed as the car spun out of control. [On his way to the wedding, says the other version. And the spin out killed both him and four of the six friends with him.] The car now rests harmlessly in a Viennese museum. It is never taken out on the road.

 Origins: This tragic story about a ten-year-old boy contracting HIV through the ingestion of a variety of foods has been
circulating on the Internet at least since May 2005.  In its earliest incarnation, the death-dealing foodstuff was said to be panipuri, a stuffed dumpling appetizer common in India. By March 2006, the deadly ingestible was being described as ""a fast food take-away,"" and by June 2006 it had become pineapple. No matter what the food, the rumor about a child contracting AIDS in this fashion is false. The Centers for Disease Control emphatically says people cannot acquire HIV from consuming food that has been handled by an HIV-infected person: Except for rare cases in which children consumed food that was pre-chewed by an HIV-infected caregiver, HIV has not been spread through food. The virus does not live long outside the body. You cannot get it from consuming food handled by an HIV-infected person; even if the food contained small amounts of HIV-infected blood or semen, exposure to the air, heat from cooking, and stomach acid would destroy the virus. The HIV virus does not long survive outside its host medium of human bodily fluids: blood, semen, vaginal fluid, breast milk, saliva, tears. (Which is not to say HIV can be transmitted by every one of those — according to the Centers for Disease Control, ""Contact with saliva, tears, or sweat has never been shown to result in transmission of HIV."") The CDC reports that except under laboratory conditions, HIV is unable to reproduce outside its living host, and therefore it does not spread or maintain infectiousness outside its host. Were HIV-tainted blood to be mixed into food, the virus would neither survive nor multiply and replenish while it was still viable. Although such cases are rare, the CDC confirms that people have acquired HIV through oral contact with, or swallowing of, HIV-laden bodily fluids. However, no known infections involving oral transmission of HIV have so far come from contact with, or ingestion of, a food product or beverage; all such infections involved sexual contact. The summer of 2006 saw a rumor similar to the panipuri/pineapple one at work in the off-line world. Police in Qufu, China, were called upon to investigate a story that someone had injected watermelons grown in Fanji (a town in the Linquan county) with HIV-tainted blood. Linquan watermelons normally fetch higher prices than do those from other regions, and the farmers in that area had earlier in the year registered a trademark and established an association to protect their pricier watermelon crops. Once afoot, the false story served to drive down the price of Linquan watermelons, and sales of the fruit quickly declined. As one Linquan farmer reported, prior to the rumor's appearance watermelons he'd harvested sold out, but after the rumor had spread only a small fraction of his crop was bought. Police suspected the whisper was started by someone looking to reap commercial benefit. The rumor about HIV being passed to a ten-year-old boy via his eating of food items echoes a theme found in other urban legends, that of dread disease contracted by random innocent parties engaging in what should be safe activities — for example, AIDS acquired via a prick from a needle affixed to the handle of a gas pump, by ingesting HIV-laden blood added to restaurant ketchup dispensers, through eating pizza to which HIV-laden semen had been added; flesh-eating contagion passed on the skins of bananas imported from Costa Rica; and Weil's Disease contracted via soda cans encrusted with rat urine. Such rumors are society's way of expressing its disquiet about having to co-exist with dread contagion even in medically advanced times.

Status: A number of real entries, one unknown, and one fiction. Example: [Collected on the Internet, 2006]  These awards are given each year to bestow upon (the remains or estate of) that individual, who through single-minded self-sacrifice, has done the most to remove undesirable elements from the human gene pool. Just think...until these events, these same people were walking the streets like normal people. 5th RUNNER-UP: Goes to a San Anselmo, California man who died when he hit a lift tower at the Mammoth mountain ski area while riding down the slope on a foam pad. 22-year old David Hubal was pronounced dead at Central Mammoth Hospital. The accident occurred about 3 a.m., the Mono County Sheriff's department said. Hubal and his friends apparently had hiked up a ski run called Stump alley and removed some yellow foam protectors from lift towers, said Lt. Mike Donnelly of the Mammoth Lakes Police Department. The pads are used to protect skiers who might hit towers. The group apparently used the pads to slide down the ski slope and Hubal crashed into a tower. It has since been investigated and determined the tower he hit was the one with its pad removed. 4th RUNNER-UP: Goes to Robert Puelo, 32, was apparently being disorderly in a St. Louis market. When the clerk threatened to call the police, Puelo grabbed a hot dog, shoved it into his mouth and walked out without paying. Police found him unconscious in front of the store. Paramedics removed the six-inch wiener from his throat where it had choked him to death. 3rd RUNNER-UP: Goes to poacher Marino Malerba of Spain, who shot a stag standing above him on an overhanging rock and was killed instantly when it fell on him. 2nd RUNNER-UP: ""Man loses face at party."" A man at a West Virginia party (probably related to the winner last year, a man
in Arkansas who used the .22 bullet to replace the fuse in his pickup truck) popped a blasting cap into his mouth and bit down, triggering an explosion that blew off his lips, teeth, and tongue. Jerry Stromyer, 24, of Kincaid, bit the blasting cap as a prank during the party late Tuesday night, said Cpl. M.D. Payne. ""Another man had it in an aquarium hooked to a battery and was trying
to explode it. It wouldn't go off and this guy said I'll show you how to set it off."" He put it into his mouth, bit down and it blew all his teeth out and his lips and tongue off, Payne said. Stromyer was listed in guarded condition Wednesday with extensive facial injuries, according to a spokesperson at Charleston Area Medical Division. ""I just can't imagine anyone doing something like that,"" Payne said. 1st RUNNER-UP: Doctors at Portland University Hospital said an Oregon man shot through the skull by a hunting arrow is lucky to be alive and will be released soon from the hospital. Tony Roberts, 25, lost his right eye last weekend during an initiation into a men's rafting club, Mountain Men Anonymous (probably known now as Stupid Mountain Men Anonymous) in Grants Pass, Oregon. A friend tried to shoot a beer can off his head, but the arrow entered Robert's right eye. Doctors said that had the arrow gone 1 millimeter to the left, a major blood vessel would have been cut and Roberts would have
died instantly. Neurosurgeon, Doctor Johnny Delashaw, at the University Hospital in Portland said the arrow
went through 8 to 10 inches of brain with the tip protruding at the rear of his skull, yet somehow managed to miss all major blood vessels. Delashaw also said that had Roberts tried to pull the arrow out on his own he surely would have killed himself. Roberts admitted afterwards that he and his friends had been drinking that afternoon. Said Roberts, ""I feel so dumb about this."" No charges have been filed, but the Josephine County district attorney's office said the
initiation stunt is under investigation. Now, THIS YEAR'S WINNER: (The late) John Pernicky and his friend, (the late) Sal Hawkins, of the great state of Washington, decided to attend a local Metallica concert at the George Washington amphitheater. Having no tickets (but having had 18 beers between them), they thought it would be easy to ""hop"" over the nine foot fence and sneak into the show. They pulled their pickup truck over to the fence and the plan was for Mr. Pernicky, who was 100 pounds heavier than Mr. Hawkins, to hop the fence and then assist his friend over. Unfortunately for (the late) Mr. Pernicky, there was a 30-foot drop on the other side of the fence. Having heaved himself over, he found himself crashing through a tree. His fall was abruptly halted (and broken, along with his arm) by a large branch that snagged him by his shorts. Dangling from the tree with a broken arm, he looked down and saw some bushes below him. Possibly
figuring the bushes would break his fall, he removed his pocket knife and proceeded to cut away his shorts to free himself from the tree. Finally free, Mr. Pernicky crashed into holly bushes. The sharp leaves scratched his ENTIRE body and now, without the protection of his shorts, a holly branch penetrated his rectum. To make matters worse, upon landing his pocket knife penetrated his thigh. Hawkins, seeing his friend in considerable pain and agony, threw him a rope and tried to pull him to safety by tying the rope to the pickup truck and slowly driving away. However, in his drunken haste, he put the truck into reverse and crashed through the fence landing on his friend and killing him. Police arrived to find the crashed pickup with its driver thrown 100 feet from the truck and dead at the scene from massive internal injuries. Upon moving the truck, they found John under it half-naked, scratches on his body, a holly stick in his rectum, a knife in his thigh, and his shorts dangling from a tree branch 25 feet in the air. Congratulations gentlemen. You win. And some more idiots have been removed from the gene pool.
 Origins: ""Named in honor of Charles Darwin, the father of evolution, the Darwin Awards commemorate those who improve our gene pool by removing themselves from it, showing us just how uncommon common sense can be,"" says Wendy Northcutt of DarwinAwards.com. Darwin Awards stories are tales that are presented as factual  accounts of the demises of people who managed to end their lives in fantastically stupid ways. Some are
works of fiction (e.g., the man who died in his sleep from breathing his own farts), some are relatively accurate recountings of actual events (e.g., the lawyer who fell through a skyscraper window while attempting to demonstrate how safe that fixture was), and a handful are wildly embellished versions of true stories (e.g., the ""pumping"" death of a 13-year-old boy in Thailand was not, as the e-mailed account would have had it, due to his having sought a sexual thrill, but happened as a result of a practical joke played upon him by two 15-year-old co-workers.) On snopes.com we chronicle a number of stories that have at various times wended their way through the online world presented as Darwin Award items — if you enter the phrase ""Darwin Award"" into our search engine, it will find them all for you. Contrary to common belief, there is no panel of distinguished judges weighing each potential Darwin Award entry then sagely reaching agreement as to which deserves an official accolade. Darwin Awards e-mails have been circulating on the Internet at least since May 1991, with the earliest e-mails and newsgroups posts of this nature setting before posterity inventive works of fiction that had been labeled by their authors as true accounts of actual deaths. Years after the term ""Darwin Award"" was being used in connection with text descriptions of deaths by misadventure, a number of web sites sprung up to archive the variety of Darwin Award tales then in circulation. Those sites not only collected the fictional offerings then making the online rounds but also on their own dug up numerous true accounts of death by stupidity, thus building a vast body of such tales, some true and some not. While other sites have since faded into obscurity, one has emerged as the clear winner: DarwinAwards.com, a site owned and maintained by Wendy Northcutt. Ms. Northcutt has since authored three highly successful books based on her site. The various ""Annual Darwin Awards"" e-mails (such as the one which is the topic of this article) do not originate with DarwinAwards.com; they are put together by persons unknown. The distinction between ""Darwin Awards"" stories versus ""dumb criminals"" tales or just generic ""stupid people"" yarns is lost on some of those anonymous anthologizers, so not every entry in such compilations would qualify under the rules laid out by DarwinAwards.com (i.e., that subjects' boneheaded acts cause them to be removed from the gene pool). Surprisingly, a number of the incidents described on this particular list actually happened. However, we begin this examination with one where the books are still open. The veracity of the 5th runner-up story, about a young man who met the Grim Reaper when the foam pad he was sliding down a ski hill on struck the lift tower the pad had been stripped from, is something we haven't yet confirmed. While the item has been circulated online since at least 1996, and the name of the lad who supposedly slid himself to death was Matthew David Hubal (rather than just David Hubal, as the list above describes him), we haven't turned up any news stories supporting such an occurrence. While some of the places we've looked have helpfully pointed towards checkable sources within the print media (e.g., The Guardian, Sacramento Bee, Associated Press), our searches through those news outlets failed to turn up any articles about the death, and searches of other news sources met with similar results. Our own scribbled notes from 1998 indicate a date of death for Matthew David Hubal of 25 March 1994, yet this long after the fact, our memory fails as to where that date came from. However, while we can't confirm that particular death, we know others have died in such fashion. On 17 February 1996, 26-year-old David Dehaven met his end in such fashion after using a bumper pad purloined from a lift tower as a sled. His improvised toboggan crashed into a padded boundary post at Steamboat Ski Resort in Colorado. On 4 February 2008, the makeshift sledge British vacationer David Monk was riding at a resort in the Italian Alps crashed into safety barriers at the foot of a ski slope, killing him. The sledge had been fashioned from the foam barrier encasing the ski lift tower that proved Monk's undoing. One of the true tales is that of the 4th runner-up, the account of a man who stole a hot dog only to choke to death on it. The 32-year-old Robert Puelo did indeed end his days as described on 10 October 1994. Paramedics who attempted to save his life did retrieve a six-inch length of frankfurter from his throat after he died, plus three smaller chunks of the dog, similarly lodged. Unverified (at least at this time) is the tale presented as the 3rd runner-up, that of the unfortunate poacher done in by the animal he shot when it landed on him. While a brief mention of this story did appear in a newspaper's round-up of unusual stories from 1993, no other supporting evidence has so far appeared. And even that brief mention changed the story a bit in claiming that the poacher went to his final reward in England, not Spain. The 2nd runner-up account of a lad who succeeded in his attempt to set off a blasting cap by biting down on it is another strange-yet-true tale. On 18 March 1986, a 24-year-old man named Jerry Stromyer did indeed blow off his lips, teeth and tongue in this manner. Also true is the 1st runner-up, the story of a fellow who took an arrow in his noggin when he allowed a friend to attempt to shoot a beer can off his head. On 1 May 1993, the 25-year-old Anthony Roberts lost his right eye to this male-bonding misadventure and almost lost his life in the bargain. The unemployed carpenter did in fact state at a press conference afterwards, ""I feel stupid."" However, the entry identified as ""This Year's Winner"" is naught but fiction. The story about an attempt to crash a Metallica concert gone woefully wrong has been kicking about the Internet since 1997, sometimes as a stand-alone tale, and sometimes as an item added to other lists of ""dumb people"" anecdotes. Numerous searches done in 1997 and in the years since have failed to turn up as much as an obituary in support of this yarn. While absence of evidence is not usually conclusive proof of falsehood, if dying with a stick of holly up your ass doesn't get your name in the paper, nothing will.

Broom Death,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/broom-hilda/,legend,Did a coed die pleasuring herself with a broom?,Barbara Mikkelson,2003-04-03,A coed fatally skewers herself while masturbating with a broom handle.,"Claim: A coed fatally skewers herself while masturbating with a broom handle. LEGEND Examples:  A story that I heard that was kind of like the hot dog one was that there was this girl who got drunk at a party then she went home and she was really horny so she used a broom stick to pleasure herself. She was standing on the table for some reason and her mom walked in on her. She jumped off the table and the broomstick went up her and it killed her. I doubt this is true but this girl just told me that.
 
 [Collected via e-mail, 1999] I heard something close to your frozen hotdog story. But it was about an athletic girl, who was doing arm pull ups. And after awhile she started to get horny from the up and down motion. So she found a broom and started to do her pull ups again, with the broom inside of her. After awhile her mom comes in to tell her that dinner is ready, but she walks in while the girl is masterbating with the broom. The mom screams and scares the girl, that she forgets the broom is underneathe her and she lets go of the bar. Then the broom goes through all of her organs, and comes out of her mouth and ends up killing the girl.
 
 [Collected via e-mail, 1999] A teenager reportedly was experimenting in her ways of masturbation. Her mother was rarely away from the house, so she had not come across too many opportunities to masturbate, but one day her mother came home from work, worn out, and told her that she was going to draw herself a bubble bath and not to expect her for at least an hour. The teenage girl took advantage of this time slot and decided to experiment with rubbing herself with various objects, and one of them was a broom. Finding she could not ""do much"" with the broom in her bed, she moved into the kitchen and situated herself on top of the refrigerator. Apparently her mother surprised her by opening the bathroom door before the hour was up, and the girl, not wanting her mother to find her in this compromising position, hurriedly hopped off of the refrigerator, without removing the broom handle. The broom handle was shoved up inside of her and came out her eye.
 
 [Collected via e-mail, 1999] My friend's dad was the director of one of our local hospitals. One day after coming home from work he told his son about something that had happened that day (even though it was supposedly confidential). He said a gay male had been admitted to the hospital that day. The problem was the guy, trying to get off, rigged up this sex toy type thing. It supposedly consisted of several pulleys attached to the ceiling and a broom, which was inserted into the rectum. The idea was when the guy, who was suspended from the ceiling or something, pulled on one rope the broom would pleasure him. But then something went terribly wrong and it broke sending the broom up the rectum and through his stomach. Later family or friends found him (embarrassing I'm sure) hanging there with a broom up his butt.
 Variations:
     our readers to ask about a related tale of masturbatory misadventure involving a broom. Though we cannot pinpoint how long this particular urban legend has been circulating, it has clearly been part of the genre for many a year. Akin to other tales of parental discovery of masturbation (e.g. one we call the Tea-Bird in the Hand), it's Mother, the ultimate moral figure who happens upon the scene of her child experimenting with self-gratification, never Dad. At least in the world of lore, fathers are not perceived as wielding the same power of disapproval mothers are expected to dish out, so good storytelling demands the parent deemed more easily shocked and less likely to be permissive about sexual matters be the one called upon to witness the act. Yet parental discovery there must be because mere death (even one involving being skewered on a broom handle) is not enough; Mother has to witness with her own eyes what her dearest darling was doing if the underlying moral of this cautionary tale is to be transmitted adequately. (Teens fear parental discovery far more than loss of life because the one is far more real a possibility to them.) In the broom story, the girl doing the experimenting pays for her expanded sexual knowledge and uncontrollable lust with her life. That same lust results in other deaths by impalement in another urban legend, the venerable ""girl on a gearshift"" tale, in which other young ladies overcome by sensations of sexual tension attempt to relieve them with equally fatal results. Underlying all of these stories are two shared themes: ""inappropriate sexual knowledge"" and ""uncontrollable lust,"" both seen as daunting concepts by the average teen. That sense of trepidation is put into words in these cautionary tales which warn teens (especially girls) against the dangers of letting their burgeoning sexual feelings take them over by presenting wildly improbable worst-case scenarios of what could happen if they ever did unleash that particular ravening beast.

Henna Tattoo Scarring,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/henna-pecked/,partly true,Can temporary black henna tattoos permanently scar children?,Barbara Mikkelson,2007-06-18,Temporary black henna tattoos can cause permanent scarring.,"<CENTER><IMG SRC=""https://slacktory.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Wigs-on-mannequin-heads.png"" WIDTH=590 HEIGHT=197></CENTER> Claim: Temporary black henna tattoos can cause permanent scarring. PARTLY TRUE Example: [Collected via e-mail, June 2007]  Friends- I am sending this email to the majority of my address book - please pass this one on. It is so important! We were in Seaside, Florida, 2 weeks ago and decided to allow our children to get ""henna tattoos"" - the adults decided to indulge, as well. This was done at a very nice, ""high-end"" place - next to $2 - 3 million dollar homes. I asked if it was ""safe"" for children and was assured that it was a ""natural"" dye with no consequence. 10 days later , my 7 yr. old and my 5 yr. old are having ""severe"" allergic reactions to the ""black henna"". Their tattoos will now, most likely, be permanent scars. They are reacting to PPD - a substance added to natural henna to make it more ""black"" and allow it to set more quickly. Now that my girls have been exposed to PPD - they can NEVER have their hair dyed - as it could be fatal. They can not ever use PABA - based sunscreens, they can not have ""Sulfa"" anti-biotics, they can not use most cosmetics, and they can not have most drugs ending in ""-caine"". Our first visit is to the dermatologist tomorrow and then to the allergist to determine the life long consequences of this exposure. PLEASE do not allow your children to get these ""all natural henna tattoos"" unless you are 100% sure they are pure henna (which has a much lower rate of allergic reaction). MAKE SURE THEY DO NOT CONTAIN PPD! It can be a life altering decision. Take care,
 Origins: While we can't yet confirm this particular story about the two tots permanently scarred by temporary henna tattoos applied in Seaside, Florida, the risks decried in the account are at least somewhat real. For thousands of years, people have relied on henna, an Old World tropical shrub of the loosestrife family, to color their hair and decorate their skin. Pure henna is green but dries to a dark brown or orange hue. To create body art (also known as mehndi), henna is mixed into a paste with essential oils and applied to the skin in intricate patterns. When left on the skin for at least four hours, the paste produces patterns that last up to just over three weeks. Temporary tattoos worked in pure henna are generally safe. (It is extremely rare to develop an allergic reaction to pure henna.) However, those executed in ""black henna"" are not always so. Black henna is a PPD-boosted synthetic version of the real thing. Para-phenylenediamine (PPD) is used in these concoctions to darken designs and thereby produce dramatic black patterns. Black henna can make delicate skin erupt into blistering redness that sometimes leads to permanent scarring. The reaction can also spread, causing grotesque full-body swelling, itching, and skin sloughing. Black henna is not always safe to use. Permanent scarring can result from its application, and a tattoo meant to be worn for a few days can become a lifelong mark. Also, someone who has had a bad reaction to black henna may afterwards become extra-sensitive to PPD and similar chemicals, including some antibiotics and local anesthetics. Future reactions will likely be more severe. Even when there isn't an immediate bad reaction to a tattoo worked in black henna, just having had that form of skin art can set up the wearer for misery in the future. Thanks to the concentration of PPD in the formulation used to execute skin designs (up to 15.7%), the temporary tattoo sensitizes its wearer to that chemical. More than two-thirds of hair dyes currently contain PPD or related chemicals, which means the former tattoo wearer may well experience a delayed hypersensitivity reaction when she decides years later to change her hair color. Said reaction can range anywhere from redness and irritation around the hairline and scalp to complete swelling of the face and a rash all over the body. In 2006, the American Contact Dermatitis Society named PPD its ""Allergen of the Year."" The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has this to say about temporary or henna tattoos: Since henna typically produces a brown, orange-brown, or reddish-brown tint, other ingredients must be added to produce other colors, such as those marketed as ""black henna"" and ""blue henna."" So-called ""black henna"" may contain the ""coal tar"" color p-phenylenediamine, also known as PPD. This ingredient may cause allergic reactions in some individuals. The only legal use of PPD in cosmetics is as a hair dye. It is not approved for direct application to the skin. Even brown shades of products marketed as henna may contain other ingredients intended to make them darker or make the stain last longer. In addition to color additives, these skin-decorating products may contain other ingredients, such as solvents. In addition to color additives, these skin-decorating products may contain other ingredients, such as solvents.
 In 2002, North Wildwood, on an island off the New Jersey shore, joined neighboring oceanfront resort Wildwood in banning henna tattoos because it found it impossible to determine which contained FDA-approved dyes and which didn't.

2006 Darwin Awards,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/2006-darwin-awards/,mixture,Does an Internet-circulated list titled '2006 Darwin Awards' detail actual deaths?,Barbara Mikkelson,2007-04-02,"Internet-circulated list titled ""2006 Darwin Awards"" details actual deaths.","Claim: Internet-circulated list titled ""2006 Darwin Awards"" details actual deaths. Status: Multiple — see below. Example: [Collected via e-mail, July 2006]  They're in, In case you haven't received them yet, here are this year's Darwin Awards — the annual honor given to the person who improved the ""gene pool"" the most by killing themselves in the most extraordinarily stupid way. As always,competition this year has been keen. And the candidates this year are ... #1 IN Detroit, a 41-year-old man got stuck and drowned in two feet of water after squeezing head first through an 18-inch-wide sewer grate to retrieve his car keys. #2 A 49-year-old San Francisco stockbroker, who ""totally zoned"" when he accidentally jogged off a 100-foot-high cliff on his daily run. #3 Buxton, NC: A man died on a beach when an 8-foot-deep hole he had dug into the sand caved in as he sat inside it. Beach-goers said Daniel Jones, 21, dug the hole for fun, or protection from the wind, and had been sitting in a beach chair at the bottom Thursday afternoon when it collapsed, burying him beneath 5 feet of sand. People on the beach on the outer banks, used their hands and shovels, trying to claw their way to Jones but could not reach him. It took rescue workers using heavy equipment almost an hour to free him while about 200 people looked on. Jones was pronounced dead at a hospital. #4 Santiago Alvarado, 24, was killed in Lompoc, CA, as he fell face-first through the ceiling of a bicycle shop he was burglarizing. Death was caused when the long flashlight he had placed in his mouth (to keep his hands free) rammed into the base of his skull as he hit the floor. #5 Sylvester Briddell, Jr., 26, was killed in Selbyville, Del, as he won a bet with friends who said he would not put a revolver loaded with four bullets into his mouth and pull the trigger. HONORABLE MENTION: #6 Paul Stiller, 47, was hospitalized in Andover township, NJ, and his wife Bonnie was also injured, when a quarter-stick of dynamite blew up in their car. While driving around 2 AM, the bored couple lit the dynamite and tried to toss it out the window to see what would happen, but apparently failed to notice the window was closed. RUNNER UP: #7 TACOMA, WA Kerry Bingham had been drinking with several friends when one of them said they knew a person who had bungee-jumped from the Tacoma Narrows Bridge in the middle of traffic. The conversation grew more heated and at least 10 men trooped along the walkway of the bridge at 4:30AM. Upon arrival at the midpoint of the bridge they discovered that no one had brought a bungee rope. Bingham, who had continued drinking, volunteered and pointed out that a coil of lineman's cable lay nearby. One end of the cable was secured around Bingham's leg and the other end was tied to the bridge. His fall lasted 40 feet before the cable tightened and tore his foot off at the ankle. He miraculously survived his fall into the icy river water and was rescued by two nearby fishermen. ""All I can say"" said Bingham, ""is that God was watching out for on that night. There's just no other explanation for it."" Bingham's foot was never located. AND THE WINNER: #8 Overzealous zookeeper Friedrich Riesfeldt (Paderborn, Germany) fed his constipated elephant Stefan 22 doses of animal laxative and more than a bushel of berries, figs and prunes before the plugged-up pachyderm finally let it fly, and suffocated the keeper under 200 pounds of poop! Investigators say ill-fated Friedrich, 46, was attempting to give the ailing elephant an olive oil enema when the relieved beast unloaded on him. ""The sheer force of the
elephant's unexpected defecation knocked Mr. Riesfeldt to the ground, where he struck his head on a rock and lay unconscious as the elephant continued to evacuate his bowels on top of him"" said flabbergasted Paderborn police detective Erik Dern. ""With no one there to help him, he lay under all that dung for at least an hour before a watchman came along, and during that time he suffocated. It seems to be just one of those freak accidents that proves that ""Shit happens!""
 Origins: ""Named in honor of Charles Darwin, the father of evolution, the Darwin Awards commemorate those who improve our gene pool by removing themselves from it, showing us just how uncommon common sense can be,"" says Wendy Northcutt of DarwinAwards.com. Darwin Awards stories are tales that are presented as factual  accounts of the demises of people who managed to end their lives in fantastically stupid ways. Some are
works of fiction (e.g., the man who died in his sleep from breathing his own farts), some are relatively accurate recountings of actual events (e.g., the lawyer who fell through a skyscraper window while attempting to demonstrate how safe that fixture was), and a handful are wildly embellished versions of true stories (e.g., the ""pumping"" death of a 13-year-old boy in Thailand was not, as the e-mailed account would have had it, due to his having sought a sexual thrill, but happened as a result of a practical joke played upon him by two 15-year-old co-workers). On snopes.com we chronicle a number of stories that have at various times wended their way through the online world presented as Darwin Award items: if you enter ""Darwin Award"" into our search engine, it will find them all for you. Contrary to common belief, there is no panel of distinguished judges weighing each potential Darwin Award entry then sagely reaching agreement as to which deserves an official accolade.

Ms. Northcutt has since authored three highly successful books based on her site. The various ""Annual Darwin Awards"" e-mails (such as the one which is the topic of this article) do not originate with DarwinAwards.com; they are put together by unknown persons. Of the eight items that make up the ""Darwin Awards 2006"" e-mail, six of them would qualify for consideration for such a prize (because the foolhardy persons who star in those tales kick the bucket), but in two of them that central figure is merely injured, making those accounts ineligible for that honor. As is the norm for such Internet-circulated lists, ""Darwin Awards 2006"" e-mail, is a mixed bag — there are some actual incidents accurately chronicled, one that we know is an out-and-out fake, and a handful of others that we can't yet authoritatively prove or disprove. Interestingly, while this compilation purports to be the 2006 list, all of its entries date from 1995 through 1998. Entry #7 (the drunk who lost a foot bungee jumping with cable off the Tacoma Narrows Bridge) is fiction. It was penned by Edward Martin III and used as the 4th entry in his ""The Top Ten 'What, No Pictures?!' ER Stories of 1995"" humor offering. From there it found its way into a 1998 newspaper-published list of stupid deaths that also presented as true incidents both the ""Failed Suicide"" legend and the ""Breasts Injure Four"" fiction, the latter of which even darwinawards.com disavowed. Entry #5 (the fellow whose friends bet him he wouldn't place a revolver loaded with four bullets into his mouth and pull the trigger) has proved resistant to confirmation: while it appears in an April 1997 ""News of the Weird"" column (which places the mishap in Selbyville, Delaware, in February 1997), it has resisted our efforts to confirm through any other source. However, we did find an entry in the Social Security Death Index that corresponded to the name, age, and state given in the tale and listed a date of death of 26 February 1997. Entry #1 is one of the accurate ones. On 28 September 1996, 41-year-old Ray Langston squeezed through an 18-inch-wide sewer grate in Detroit to try to retrieve his car keys. He became pinned headfirst in a hole and drowned in two feet of water. Entry #2 (the ""totally zoned"" stockbroker who ran off a cliff) was reported by the San Francisco Chronicle in 1996: Family members say San Francisco stockbroker Jack Sullivan followed a pattern in his life, and the one day he broke the routine it killed him. A beautiful San Francisco day persuaded Sullivan to take his normal Sunday jog a day early on a different route. The path he chose below the Lincoln Park golf course was a treacherous one, and Sullivan apparently misjudged it. Witnesses saw him jog down the coastal trail next to the 17th hole, turn and run off the cliff at the Eagle Point overlook. His body was found 200 feet below. [Sullivan's wife] said she was convinced her husband hadn't committed suicide, saying he was happy with his life and had made plans to play golf with a friend the following day. A more likely explanation, she said, is that her husband wasn't concentrating on the path because he was collecting his thoughts and making plans. ""Jack totally zoned when he ran,"" Catherine Sullivan said. ""He usually ran with a little tape recorder that he would talk into, because that's how he got his ideas.""

 Entry #3 is also accurate. Daniel Jones, a 21-year-old resident of Woodbridge, Virginia, died on 7 August 1997 when the 8-foot-deep hole he'd dug at the beach on the Outer Banks in Buxton, North Carolina, collapsed on him, burying him under 5 feet of sand. Though numerous beachgoers tried to dig him out, they were unsuccessful, and workers using heavy equipment eventually freed him almost an hour later, by which time it was too late. Entry #4 (the bicycle shop burglar done in by his own flashlight) is another the accurate ones. 25-year-old Santiago Alvarado was discovered dead on the floor of a bicycle shop in Lompoc, California, on 3 February 1997. He had apparently entered the shop through its roof. The flashlight found lodged in his throat had severed the second verterbrae in his neck and it is believed he died instantly from the injury. Entry #6, the story of the clueless self-dynamiters, is true, says the Associated Press. Around 2 a.m. on the morning of 30 September 1996, Paul and Bonnie Stiller were injured by an explosion in their car when the quarter-stick of dynamite Paul was holding went off in his hand. The couple's plan had been to light the stick and throw it from the car window, but alas, they lit the explosive before rolling down the window. Mrs. Stiller was treated then released, but Mr. Stiller was admitted to Newton Memorial Hospital with unspecified injuries. The police report said the couple had been drinking, and Mrs. Stiller was charged with driving under the influence. The Stillers were both charged with possession of explosives in a vehicle, and police said two more quarter-sticks of dynamite were found at the couple's home. The final entry, the one dubbed ""THE WINNER,"" is a tale we delved into on this site long ago. While elephants may be able to produce a large amount of excretia, the sad account of the shat-upon zookeeper is naught but a piece of Weekly World News fiction from 1998.

Webkinz Murderer,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/webkinz-murderer/,false,Are children's Webkinz being murdered online?,Barbara Mikkelson,2008-01-01,Children's Webkinz are being murdered online.,"Claim: Children's Webkinz are being murdered online. Status: False. Examples:  My children came home from school today, and all the talk in first and second grade was of some kind of webkinz malware. A black, red or yellow box appears in your webkinz world. If you click on the black box, a neopet pops out with a knife, and chops your webkinz' head off. The red box does the same thing. If you click on a yellow box, you loose all your webkinz possessions and ""money"". It sounds like a legend to me. But little kids are telling my kids, ""This happened to me."" Not sure what to think.
 
 [Collected via e-mail, February 2007] My kids came home from school yesterday telling me they heard of a computer virus issues associated with their webkins (or webkinz). webkinz are stuffed animals which you can buy and then somehow use the web to play games, etc. with friends who also have the animals. The virus comes on the screen as a penguin with red eyes and ruins your PC.
 
 [Collected via e-mail, March 2007] What I am hearing is that several of the kids at school have logged onto their webkinz and when they check their house, there is a killer bear roaming around with a knife and it stabs the other animals. Supposedly a neighbor logged into hers and one of her animals was found lying in a pool of blood.
 
 [Collected via e-mail, April 2007] This webkinz virus thing is TOTALLY true. it happened 2 half my friends on webkinz. there is either some kind of gift on the floor or some kind of bomby thingy. it pops out like you got a gift. then Dr. Quack or Miss Birdie pops up, lights go out, red eyes come, it makes slashing noises on your computer, and then the lights turn on and your webkinz are dead on the floor with blood on them. You probably think that webkinz people would never do that. you are right, but NEOPETS would. Why? because they got angry that everyone went on webkinz and nobody went on neopets anymore, so they hacked into webkinz and put in some kind of virus. It is pretty scary for kids, so be careful with what you do with your webkinz and DONT GO TO YOUR ROOM!!!
 Origins: In 2005 toymaker Ganz created ""Webkinz,"" a series of plush toys fashioned in the shape of fuzzy animals. These playthings can be dressed in outfits specifically sold for such purpose and played with in the real world by their young owners, but what sets these particular dolls apart from other collections of ""plushies"" (e.g., Beanie Babies, Ty Punkies) is that each Webkinz  comes with a secret code that gives its owner access to the online Webkinz World where the purchased ""pet"" can also be created and then played with as an online version of itself. Webkinz owners buy toys, clothes and even furnishings for their pets' rooms in this cyber playland, paying for such purchases with Kinzcash, a virtual type of money gained by playing educational games on the web site or by spinning the site's ""Wheel of Wow."" As in the face-to-face world, little girls who play with their dollies in the online world fear for their charges' safety. In the face-to-face world, what needs to be feared are horrid boys who will rip off dolls' heads just to make their owners cry, but in cyberspace it's the ""Webkinz Killer,"" a maliciously-placed element that randomly appears in Webkinz World to lay waste to the cyber versions of children's cherished plush toys. Early in 2007, the online playground was swept by rumors of this killer, which was said to lurk within Webkinz World. The rumor has taken many forms: Some say the killer is a virus that appears on the user's screen as penguin with red eyes that first lays waste to the user's Webkinz, then ruins her computer. Or that ""a black, red or yellow box appears in your webkinz world. If you click on the black box, a neopet pops out with a knife, and chops your webkinz' head off."" (A Neopet is another type of virtual pet found on a competing site.) Or that various creatures within the Webkinz World (such as a penguin, Dr. Quack,Mrs. Duck,Ms. Birdy, or a ""killer Chihuahua"" or ""killer bear"") randomly pop up within the game to slay users' beloved playthings. As to what happens to Webkinz who encounter the ""killer,"" rumor asserts they ""have their heads chopped off"" or are set upon ""with chainsaws."" The killer(s) ""hides behind trees and kills Webkinz"" or ""comes after them with a knife if they clicked on them in a certain way."" Or the innocent playthings meet their gruesome ends by stooping to pick up ""some kind of gift on the floor or some kind of bomby thingy."" Others describe that the attack or virus ""makes slashing noises on your computer, and then the lights turn on and your webkinz are dead on the floor with blood on them."" Blood and gore appear to play large roles in these virtual deaths. Dr. Quack, the game's online physician, is frequently fingered as the Webkinz Killer. (Like their Tamagotchi predecessors, online Webkinz get sick if they're not tended to every few days. Unlike Tamagotchi, however, sick Webkinz don't die; they merely display as having green snouts and ice packs on their heads. A visit to Dr. Quack and the forking over of some Kinzcash sets that malady to rights.) As the Webkinz Killer, Dr. Quack supposedly ""will appear with red eyes and a knife and will kill the Webkinz"" or take after them ""with a chainsaw."" Likewise, Ms. Birdy (the penguin who helps new owners through the online registration process of their pets) is also said to come after Webkinz with a chainsaw or to chase them down with a knife after her eyes turn a fiery red. As to who might have set these killers loose within the game, the rumors offer a variety of theories, such as a random computer virus somehow came to infect the Webkinz site, or the playground was deliberately assaulted by clubpenguin.com and Neopets.com (competing online virtual pet sites), or ""some kind of past employee"" caused the mayhem. (The ""angered ex-employee"" routinely appears in other rumors about something objectionable having been slipped into a product one would think wholly innocuous, such as the tale about a disgruntled artist who deliberately drew a male body part into the cover art for The Little Mermaid or the lexicographer who inserted an unusual definition for 'mutton' into the 1999 edition of Random House's dictionary.) All the tales about a ""Webkinz Killer"" are false; there just isn't any such critter. As Webkinz says about the rumor: Many people have been writing in, asking about a rumor that is going around. The rumor is about something in Webkinz World hurting Webkinz pets. The most important thing to know is that this rumor is not true at all. Nothing in Webkinz World would ever hurt your Webkinz pets. Everyone at Webkinz World Headquarters works really hard to make Webkinz World a safe, happy and fun place to play. We want you and your Webkinz pets to have a great time playing on the site. Please make sure to tell your friends that their pets are safe and the rumor is not true. Remember that we would never allow anything to hurt your Webkinz pets.

 In the online world at least, Webkinz can't die. While they might at times get sick, they can always be restored to the pink of health by a visit to Dr. Quack. Other Webkinz rumors have come to our attention. They too are false: [Collected via e-mail, April 2007] They were also told that if they kick their Webkinz (again, online), they will get special prizes and their Webkinz would bleed. And then there was the rumor that if they put ""evil"" in their user names, their pets would die! [Collected via e-mail, November 2007] Rumor going around Bexley, OH that there is a Webkinz thief that can steal your Webkinz pets while you are logged onto the site, so people are being warned not to use the site. Have heard there is a ""bloody hand"" that appears when the ""thief"" is stealing the pets/information. They were also told that if they kick their Webkinz (again, online), they will get special prizes and their Webkinz would bleed. And then there was the rumor that if they put ""evil"" in their user names, their pets would die!

 Rumors about bad things happening to cyberspatial Webkinz are just that: rumors. They are expressions of anxiety, specifically that the more one cherishes something, the more one fears harm will come to it. Few things are beloved more by little girls and boys than their favorite toys, so it is far from suprising that a rumor about these playthings being laid waste to in gory fashion in their cyberspace playground would both spread far and wide and be deeply believed by the children who have put so much of their time, energy, and even their love into their online pets. While an actual stuffed toy can be clutched to one's bosom and hidden from harm under the covers, online expressions of same cannot be so safeguarded, hence the anxiety that something will get them.

Red Meat Impacts Feces in Colon,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/meat-your-maker-2/,false,Did John Wayne's autopsy reveal 40 pounds of impacted feces in his colon?,David Mikkelson,1999-11-28,John Wayne's autopsy revealed 40 pounds of impacted fecal matter lodged in his colon.,"Claim: John Wayne's autopsy revealed 40 pounds of impacted fecal matter lodged in his colon. Status: False. Examples:  By the way when they did an autopsy on John Wayne (Mr. Macho himself) 40 pounds of impacted fecal matter was removed from his death inducing cancerous colon. That's because Humans are not evolved for Animal eating. Animal fats lodge in the folds and pockets of our intestines. Carnivores have smooth intestinal linings and do not have these problems.
 
 [Hainer, 1999] It's said that, according to the autopsy, John Wayne had 40 pounds of impacted fecal matter in his body at death. Elvis reportedly had 60 pounds.
 Origins: Advocates of colonic irrigation products of dubious benefit use scarelore like the examples quoted above to indict the American ""goo and glue"" diet and validate their claim that the practice is a safe and effective means of curing a variety of ailments by purging the body of all sorts of sludge and toxins. Vegetarian groups employ this horror story to demonstrate that a meat-based diet is both unnatural and unhealthy for human beings. Hence stories circulate about alleged post-mortem discoveries that celebrities (such as John Wayne and Elvis Presley) who epitomized the ""meat and potatoes"" diet, gluttony, or other negative eating habits had some tremendous amount (40, 60, or even 80 pounds) of ""impacted fecal matter"" or ""impacted feces"" lodged in their intestines. Anecdotes such as these are, in a word, crap. It is possible for fecal matter to become impacted and lodge in the digestive system. In most cases, the colon tissues eventually stretch so that stool can push its way around the impacted matter and be evacuated. If this condition continues too long, however, the colon can stretch to the point that its nerves are no longer capable of receiving signals effectively, and the afflicted person loses voluntary control over the contraction of his bowel muscles and becomes incontinent. Now, think about how long a person would have to suffer with a serious and painful affliction such as this one to accumulate 80 pounds (or 60 pounds or 40 pounds) of ""impacted fecal matter."" In 1994, an Israeli man sought medical attention because he was suffering from severe constipation two days after having eaten a large quantity of pomegranates. He refused to allow doctors to adminster an enema, fled the hospital, and returned a week later in severe pain and bleeding from his rectum. This time the doctors operated to remove the impacted feces. How much fecal matter did they remove? Half a kilogram, or a little over a pound. Just one pound of impacted feces was causing extreme pain and rectal bleeding in this patient, but we're to believe that people can accumulate up to 80 pounds of the stuff without even being aware of it? No matter what the medical possibilities might be, the prototypical John Wayne example is still a demonstrable lie: No autopsy was performed on John Wayne when he succumbed to cancer in 1979. The medical examiner's office had no reason to hold an autopsy since Wayne had obviously died from natural causes, and hospital pathologists had little to learn by requesting the autopsy of a cancer patient who had already undergone several major surgeries (and Wayne's family would have denied such a request in any case). In fact, Wayne's relatives were so intent on fending off a crush of media and fan attention after his death that they hired a security guard to block access to his hospital room, had his body quickly and secretly transferred to a mortuary, held a funeral service attended only by family and a few friends at 5:45 in the morning, and had him interred in a plot without a headstone. Nobody had the chance to perform an autopsy on John Wayne, much less to ""run his gut"" and weigh the amount of fecal material found within. (Wayne did undergo surgery for an intestinal blockage about a month before his death, but that blockage was caused by the spread of the cancer that was killing him, not by an accumulation of waste products.) This claim was somewhat true about Elvis Presley (in concept if not in actual quantity), but not for the reasons we're led to believe. According to an account based on the report by the four doctors who performed the post-mortem examination of the entertainer: The colon is approximately five to seven feet in length in a person Elvis's size and should have been about two inches in diameter ... however, Elvis's colon was at least three and a half inches in diameter in some places and as large as four and half to five inches in diameter in others ... [T]he megacolon was jam-packed from the base of the descending colon all the way up and halfway across the transverse colon. It was filled with white, chalklike fecal material. This account makes it sound like Elvis was a prime example of the hazards of the ""goo and glue"" diet, but his poor eating habits (greasy, cholesterol-laden foods such as cheeseburgers, french fries, bacon, fried peanut butter and banana sandwiches, ice cream) were far less responsible for the condition of his colon than other factors, such as his congenitally twisted ganglionic fold, his overuse of laxatives, and, primarily, his prolonged drug abuse. As one of the autopsy doctors described, ""When you take downer-type drugs, depressants, narcotics, a lot of them, most of them, have the concomitant effect of slowing down the digestive system. In other words, the locomotive action of the bowel quits working, so it gets packed with food, and then it gets packed with more food. And it sits there distended and full of food, and that causes the colon to stretch."" In other words, it was drugs, not meat, that caused the severely impacted condition of Elvis' colon. None of this is to say that treatments such as colonic irrigation have absolutely no therapeutic value, or that most of us wouldn't do well to change our diets to cut down (or possibly eliminate) our intake of meat, or that the morality of killing animals for food is not open to debate. The point is, however, that no one soberly considering these issues should allow himself to be influenced by the type of propagandistic misinformation contained in Internet anecdotes such as these.
