"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/devils-voice-tv-aug-29-1968/" "false" "This appears to be an urban legend of recent origin." "David Emery" 2023-03-25 "\"On August 29th, 1968, all the televisions in America were shut down. There was a murmuring on the TV that some believe was the devil's voice. The televisions were off for about 25 seconds. No one knows what the issue was and no one knows what the sound was from the TVs.\"" "Here's a historical claim with an eerie supernatural twist that we've been asked to check out many times. This version was sent to us in 2016 by a reader named Neil:  I heard this thing that on August 29, 1968, every single TV went out across America at the same time. There was a strange noise coming from the TV, and some thought that it was the voice of the devil. The televisions were off for about 25 seconds, and no one was ever able to figure out what happened. We have yet to come across a variant that provides any more detail than this: On Aug. 29, 1968, every TV set in America simultaneously \"went out,\" \"turned off,\" or \"shut down\" (meaning, perhaps, that the broadcast signal was interrupted) for about 25 seconds, during which time the televisions emitted a \"strange noise\" or \"murmuring\" sound, which some people took to be \"the voice of the devil.\"  This type of viral story is often called \"creepypasta,\" which in turn is a form of \"copypasta\" — as in a text (or text combined with images) that is copied and pasted and shared ad nauseam on the internet. We'll state up front that there is no historical evidence that any such thing occurred — not on that date or any other. In fact, we'll go so far as to say that short of some sort of supernatural intervention — by the devil, let's say — no such thing as all the TVs in America shutting down all at once could occur. And even if, for the sake of argument, the devil did do it, the incident would not have gone unnoticed and unreported by every single news outlet in the country. It would be in the historical record. There would be eyewitness accounts. But none exist. Nevertheless, the story — such as it is — continues to be told and retold in tweets, memes, and online videos. This version was tweeted in 2015 (thus far, we haven't found any tellings or mentions of the story prior to 2014):   This meme version appeared in a Facebook post in 2022:  The tale has also been retold in TikTok videos, and there even exists a YouTube clip that is alleged to contain actual \"confirmed footage\" of the incident as it (supposedly) happened:   We now return to our regularly scheduled programming." 2023 "Mar" 3 1960

"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/video-jersey-devil-perched-in-tree/" "false" "The famous cryptid is part of New Jersey folklore." "Bethania Palma" 2022-12-11 "A video shows a real \"Jersey Devil\" cryptid perched in a tree." "In October 2022, an Instagram page called Mysteries Unexplained posted a video of a strange-looking creature, alleging that it was a flying cryptid known as the Jersey Devil. As of this writing, we are unsure of the origins of the video — but the Jersey Devil is an item of folklore originating in Leeds Point, a rural area in Atlantic County, in eastern New Jersey. The video shows the silhouette of what appears to be a four-legged creature with a round head and bat-like wings purchased on a tree branch. It then spreads its wings and flies off, to the chagrin of the person presumably holding the camera:  We would note that the video is very grainy, but it doesn't appear to have been taken in a rural part of New Jersey. It takes place on what appears to be a populated city street, with cars, motorcycles, homes, and electrical wires visible. The person holding the camera isn't speaking English, raising questions about whether the video originated from somewhere in the U.S. or elsewhere. There's also background music , which makes us wonder if the original source was an amateur fictional film of some kind. We invite readers who may recognize the video to contact us with tips about its origins. Cryptids are a common fixture in folklore, with the most famous ones perhaps being the Loch Ness Monster and Bigfoot. The Jersey Devil legend originated in the 1730s. According to Atlantic County's website, the story varies depending on who is telling it, but most versions detail the birth of a cursed child: One of the most famous stories tells of a place called Leeds Point. On a stormy night in 1735, a Quaker woman gave birth to a child during a thunderstorm. The room flickered with candlelight. The wind howled. Some believed her to be a sorceress. The impoverished woman, known as Mother Leeds, was believed to have many other children – as many as twelve. Some say the child was born deformed. Some say she cursed the child because of her dire straits. Other accounts say the child was born normal and took on odd characteristics later, characteristics such as an elongated body, winged shoulders, a large horse-like head, cloven feet and a thick tail. According to legend, the child was confined until it made its escape either out the cellar door or up the chimney. The Jersey Devil had been born. The Jersey Devil's notoriety, like many cryptids, has remained strong in centuries since it originated. Snopes debunked another alleged Jersey Devil sighting in 2015." 2022 "Dec" 12 1730

"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/air-fryer-fire-facebook/" "true" "Readers asked us to verify the contents of a Facebook post that described a purported fire hazard involving air fryers and power surges." "Jordan Liles" 2022-11-30 "A plugged-in air fryer underwent a power surge and caused a kitchen fire, despite the fact that it was plugged in to a special outlet for protection." "On June 18, 2022, Facebook user Cindy Jennings posted that her kitchen had experienced what appeared in a picture to be a large fire. According to her post, the fire was caused by a plugged-in air fryer that had undergone a power surge when electricity was turned back on inside her home. \"So please unplug your air fryers when not in use,\" the end of the post read. Readers asked us if this story was true, as it was being copied and pasted by other users. The post in question was being copied and pasted as follows: FROM CINDY- Ughhh, the one thing i wanted to tell everyone in my last post but I forgot to tell you my minds not working right yet. But, what caused this was our air fryer. We left it plugged in and when the electric came back on it surged through it. We even had it plugged into a special outlet for protection- it failed anyway what i wanted to tell you was the fire inspector said this was the 6th air fryer fires he's had to do, they (firefighters) are trying to get air fryer companies looked into because of all the fires. So please unplug your air fryers when not in use Note: Jennings' post mentioned a previous post. However, that previous post was not visible to users who were not her Facebook friends. We looked to verify three key pieces of information for the readers who asked us to look into this story. We wanted to confirm that a power surge in an air fryer, which was said to have been plugged in with a surge protection product, was the cause of a fire inside Jennings' home. Second, we looked to verify with firefighters whom she said she spoke with that they had seen several air fryer fires just like this one, and that they were trying to get the problem looked at by investigators. We also wanted to find more details about any past recalls of air fryers. According to publicly-viewable information on Jennings' Facebook profile, she appeared to live in Surfside Beach, South Carolina. We attempted to reach out by phone and email using contact information that we found online. We also sent her a message through Messenger. One of our questions would be to ask if the fire she described occurred in the town listed on her profile, or if it had happened elsewhere. We did not receive any responses. In the case that the kitchen fire involving the air fryer and the power surge did happen in Surfside Beach, we contacted the Surfside Beach Fire Department. On the day after we first published this story, we spoke by phone with Keith Williams, the department's fire marshal. \"We can find no calls that we have ran that would have been in this nature,\" Williams told us. \"We can't find a call in our county database or in our municipal database that would match up to this call Ms. Jennings would have had.\" By email, Williams also added that he would bring the supposed incident up at an upcoming fire marshal meeting for Horry County, in order to find out if any other members were aware of an air fryer fire under the name of Jennings. After finding no luck with our Surfside Beach search, we noticed that Jennings' profile also mentioned that she was apparently originally \"from Chesterville, Ohio.\" An online search for Jennings' name on the public-information website WhitePages.com showed a person with the same name supposedly residing in Marengo, Ohio. The listing showed an address at a mobile home park named Bennington Springs. Chesterville and Marengo are both located within the jurisdiction of the Big Walnut Joint Fire District. On the Facebook page for the Big Walnut Joint Fire District, a post was made on the morning of June 15, just three days before the air fryer fire post from Jennings. The post said that a storm had caused a power loss in the area. It also mentioned that there had been a structure fire at the Bennington Springs mobile home park. This information seemed to line up with the details in Jennings' post. Big Walnut Joint Fire District has been busy the last 24 hours, as a result of the storm and power loss we have responded to 18 calls for service including 2 structure fires. 1st fire was with Fredericktown Fire on Yankee Road, and 2nd in Bennington Springs mobile home park. Many of our members have gone almost 24 hours with no sleep. We want to thank the community for continuing to support the Big Walnut Fire District so we can be there for you in times like this. We soon received confirmation from the fire department that Jennings' story was true. Here's what a spokesperson for the Big Walnut Joint Fire District had to say via email: Our department, Big Walnut Joint Fire District, did have a fire on 6/14/2022 at Bennington Springs mobile home park. The picture you included is that scene. It was following a power outage that was county wide due to several tornadoes. The power had been returned to the area approximately three hours prior to the fire. The residents had left the occupancy prior to the power returning.  Our investigator, who is with multiple agencies, did rule the cause as the air fryer. This is the only fire our department has experienced with the origin being an air fryer. He stated there have been others - that is from his experience at other departments. This individual is no longer with our department. I do not know the final findings declared by their insurance investigator. The air fryer had been left plugged in to a standard residential GFI outlet. The extension cord [visible in the picture] was for the refrigerator which was being powered by a generator. With the mystery solved, we were also curious to find information on air fryer recalls that had occurred in 2022. On April 21, 2022, Best Buy recalled around 772,000 Insignia air fryers and air fryer ovens, saying it was because they could \"overheat, posing fire and burn hazards.\" Later, on Oct. 13, 2022, NewAir recalled 11,750 of its own Magic Chef air fryers too, also because of the same reason. It's unclear what make and model of air fryer appeared in the picture posted by Jennings. Note: We also found this picture and story being discussed and shared in other posts on Reddit, Twitter, and Facebook." 2022 "Nov" 11 2020

"In early December 2022, amid an ongoing public furor over lurid ad campaigns for the fashion house Balenciaga that featured child exploitation and BDSM themes, social media users shared what appeared to be a Balenciaga ad promoting a men's jacket made of human skin. In reality, however, the photograph used in the \"ad\" was then roughly five years old, had nothing to do with Balenciaga or any Balenciaga product, and had been deceptively edited to bear the company's logo. (Twitter screenshot) (Twitter screenshot) The picture, which did not originally contain a Balenciaga logo, was taken from an Etsy page active in January 2017 that offered faux human-skin garments created by Australian special effects artist Kayla Arena. Here are a few of the products that were advertised on the page at the time:  (Kayla Arena's Etsy Page, January 2017) Arena uses latex and silicone to simulate human skin in her creations, which more recently have included fake-but-real-looking corpses and body parts she constructed for the Guillermo Del Toro horror anthology TV series \"Cabinet of Curiosities.\"  We emphasize, again, that none of these creations were made using real human flesh, and none of them are connected in any way with Balenciaga.  A similar deceptive social media campaign was built around a falsely labeled picture purporting to show Balenciaga stylist Lotta Volkova covered in blood and modeling a \"satanic\" outfit." 2022 "Dec" 12 2010

"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/snorting-smarties/" "legend" "Citing a doctor, a 2009 warning to parents from a Rhode Island middle school claimed maggots could \"feed on the sugary dust wedged inside the nose.\"" "David Mikkelson" 2014-01-22 "Schoolkids are “snorting” and “smoking” Smarties and putting themselves at risk of contracting nasal maggots." "There are a number of YouTube videos of people chopping up and snorting Smarties (candy). Articles state that kids can get \"nasal maggots\" from doing this. Regardless of how idiotic this practice may be, \"nasal maggots\" smells like a parental scare story to me, and I, for one, am highly skeptical of this; as far as I know, flies lay maggots in rotten flesh, not \"rotting candy in nasal passages.\" Smarties are, in the U.S. at least, a brightly-colored, fruit-flavored, pill-sized form of candy produced by the Smarties Candy Company and sold in cellophane-wrapped rolls. (In Canada, Smarties are known as Rockets, and in the UK, Smarties refers to another type of candy entirely, colorful chocolate-coated spheroids similar to M&Ms.)  In recent years, news accounts have popped up at various times, reporting (always as a supposedly new trend) “fads” and “epidemics” of schoolkids crushing up Smarties and either “snorting” the resulting powder (i.e., inhaling it into their nasal passages) or “smoking it” (i.e., putting it in their mouths and attempting to blow it out of their noses), with the Wall Street Journal writing back in March 2009 that: Summit Middle School in Frisco, Colo., is a tobacco-free campus. Students who smoke cigarettes are suspended. But when a lunchtime crew of sixth-graders last fall started “smoking” Smarties, the tart, chalky candy discs wrapped in cellophane, lunchroom monitors and the school nurse were flummoxed. The children didn’t light the candy. They crushed it into a fine powder in its wrapper, tore off one end, poured the powder into their mouths and blew out fine Smarties dust, mimicking a smoker’s exhale. “It was freaky,” says Corinne McGrew, a nurse for Summit School District. “My biggest concern was that they would aspirate the wrapper or a whole Smarties and it would be a choking hazard.” The fad at Summit Middle School died down after a few days and some harsh words from the lunchroom staff. But at other schools and across the Internet, “smoking Smarties,” as the activity has been labeled, is gaining popularity. Some children have even taken to snorting it, all to the horror of parents, teachers and the 60-year-old company that manufactures the candy. “Snorting” Smarties is something many youngsters across the years have engaged in once or twice as a lark or a dare. But, as with so many other similar “look at this terrible thing kids these days are doing” warnings propagated by adults, the instances of kids talking about snorting Smarties, school administrators issuing dire warnings about it, and inventive youngsters posting videos about how to do it all appear to vastly outstrip the real-world incidence of the phenomenon. The latest recurrence of interest in the purported Smarties-snorting craze was prompted by a January 2014 notice issued to parents about this “unsafe, new trend among students” and the risks thereof by Portsmouth Middle School in Rhode Island: Important Health Information for Parents Regarding the Candy, Smarties Recently, we have experienced an unsafe, new trend among our middle school students — smoking or snorting the candy, Smarties. Our research has taught us this phenomenon is happening across the country and is the subject of many You-Tube videos. To smoke Smarties, students crush the candies into a fine powder while it is still in its wrapper, tear off an end, pour the powder into their mouths and blow out the smoke. Some are able to put the powder into their mouths and blow it out their noses. Thus, they imitate a smoker’s exhale. To snort Smarties, students use a straw or a rolled up piece of paper to snort the fine, crushed candy powder up into their nasal cavities. Students are also using the candy Pixie Stix in the same manner. The “benefit” for students engaging in this practice is unknown. However, the risks, associated with inhaling Smarties smoke or snorting Smarties, are many and include: - Cuts — if the Smarties have not been finely crushed, pieces may act like razor blades cutting the tissue with which they come in contact. - Infection — sugar residue may remain in the nasal cavity, sinuses and/or lungs. This residue may lead to infections, cough, wheezing, and possible respiratory arrest. - Scarring of the nasal cavity — anything snorted can lead to scarring of the nasal passages. Also if a piece of the Smartie becomes lodged in the nasal cavity it may need to be removed by a specialist. - Irritation of the lungs — smoking or snorting Smarties can lead to a smoker’s cough which can cause laryngospasms causing the voice box to spasm or close. - Allergic reaction — if the child is allergic to sugar snorting or smoking Smarties can lead to an immediate allergic reaction which untreated may lead to respiratory arrest and death. - Possible Maggots — Dr. Oren Friedman, a Mayo Clinic nose specialist, has cautioned that frequent snorting could even rarely lead to maggots feeding on the sugary dust wedged inside the nose. - Precursor to future cigarette smoking and drug use — although there is no addictive piece to Smarties, the concern is this behavior will lead to cigarette smoking or snorting of drugs. This time around, the penultimate item on that list about the perils of snorting Smarties including “nasal scarring, infection, lung irritation, allergic reaction, or possible maggots” really caught the public’s attention (even though it had been included in similar news reports published five years earlier). Sucking crushed Smarties into your nose puts you at risk of “nasal maggots”? Really? Smarties are made of dextrose, citric acid, calcium stearate, various “natural and artificial flavors,” and food colorings. There’s nothing inherently toxic about them, although snorting anything into one’s nose brings a risk of blockage, infection, and nasal or pulmonary irritation. Contracting maggots from snorting Smarties, however, appears at this point to be little more than a theoretical possibility rather than a documented hazard. The school warning reproduced above listed it among the “risks associated with inhaling Smarties smoke or snorting Smarties” and referenced Dr. Oren Friedman, a Mayo Clinic nose specialist, on the subject, apparently picking up his having mentioned that risk as a “rare” possibility in an article published back in 2009: Mark Shikowitz, an ear, nose and throat doctor at Schneider Children’s Hospital in New Hyde Park, N.Y., treated a boy about 9 years old who complained his nose was burning because of a Smarties incident. (His parents brought in a Smarties wrapper but weren’t sure how he’d ingested them.) Dr. Shikowitz determined that part of a Smarties must have lodged in the boy’s nose until it dissolved. The child wasn’t harmed. Dr. Shikowitz says Smarties may cause irritation to throats and noses — and even lungs if inhaled — but are not likely life-threatening because they eventually will dissolve. 'I still don’t think it’s a great idea,' he says. Possibility of Maggots Oren Friedman, a Mayo Clinic nose specialist, cautioned that frequent use could lead to infections or even worse, albeit rare, conditions, such as maggots that feed on sugary dust wedged inside the nose. The hard deadlines website queried Friedman on that issue, and he acknowledged that he had not studied Smarties-snorting in particular or ever witnessed a case of Smarties-induced nose maggots, but stated that he “had seen maggots in the nose from other food products in general”: 'We did not do a study on this in particular … however … we often see patients with foreign materials in their noses which can cause a variety of problems — even years after the insult occurs.  The sugar in Smarties can irritate the nose acutely and over the long term. In addition to the local irritation from the foreign material and powder, over time, the Smarties can lead to various overgrowth of bugs including viruses/fungi/bacteria. The quote regarding the maggots relates to the fact that when a foreign material, and especially a food, resides in the nose for a long period of time, infections may occur, worms may reside in the nose, even maggots may flourish in this environment — and we have encountered such a problem in the past. Hopefully the thought of possible maggots in the nose will help dissuade children from snorting the Smarties.' When asked in a followup if he had actually ever seen Smarties cause maggots, he replied, 'Just a possibility. I have seen maggots in the nose from other food products in general.' So yeah, some kids have tried snorting Smarties (and will probably be trying it for as long as Smarties exist), and yes, that practice does have some potential health risks. But snorting Smarties appears to be far more a subject of gossip than actual practice, documented health problems stemming from actual occurrences of it are few and mild, and contracting nasal maggots from it is a remote possibility not yet observed in real life." 2014 "Jan" 1 2000

"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/the-eyes-of-texas/" "false" "Some versions of this rumor posit that the cow eyes are used as hamburger filler, or to make beef patties stick together better." "David Mikkelson" 2000-10-09 "The McDonald’s restaurant chain is the world’s largest purchaser of cow eyeballs." "The claim that McDonald’s is the world’s largest purchaser of cow eyeballs shares roots with many other “beware of fast food” legends. In this particular case, the sentiment is of the “huge fast food corporations only care about profits, so they’ll put anything they can (legally) get away with in their food to save money” variety. Snopes came across the below-displayed message online in 1999: A few weeks ago I was watching “Politically Incorrect” with Bill Maher on TV and one of the guests made a remark in a quite serious voice that the Billion dollar fast food chain McDonald’s, is the largest purchaser of cow eyeballs. Now I’ve hear about Burger King using camel meat and stuff, but this one was new to me. And the fact that Mcdonald’s doesn’t have an email address to contact them nor a toll free number doesn’t give me much reassurance on the matter. Similar expressions of this anxiety have resulted in widespread tales about McDonald’s making hamburgers from worm meat, using chicken feathers in their shakes, and even purchasing food supplies from a company named “100% Beef” so that they can put any old dreck in their burgers while still legitimately advertising that they use “100% Beef products.” We don’t know what the going rate for cow eyeballs is, but we suspect that — just like worms — they’re too expensive to be practical as an alternative to real beef for a restaurant chain looking to save on their food costs. You’d think they’d be dirt cheap, because after all, who the heck would want cow eyeballs? They actually do have other uses, however — many schools purchase them for students to dissect in biology labs, for example. Whatever the market price of cow eyeballs, the idea of using them as filler in beef (or even in place of beef) just isn’t practical. The wholesale price of beef for companies who purchase as much of it as McDonald’s does is already very low, and the amount of “eyeball meat” available per cow is miniscule compared to the amount of “real” beef produced per animal. If you really have your doubts about this one, check out the ingredient lists on the McDonald’s website. All of their hamburgers are made from “100% beef patties”; furthermore, they define “beef patty” as being “100% pure USDA inspected beef; no additives, no fillers, no extenders.” This means exactly what it says. When the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) grades beef, it grades beef; it doesn’t allow beef marketers to use the word as if it merely meant “cow parts.” Some versions of this rumor posit that the cow eyes are used only as hamburger filler, or to make beef patties stick together better, or as tenderizer, or as thickener in milk shakes. Still, one has to wonder what the (presumably more expensive) alternative to cow eyeballs is, and what all the other fast food chains who can’t get cow eyes (because McDonald’s has cornered the market) use instead, and why competitors’ products don’t cost significantly more (or are noticeably inferior) as a result. If you really don’t want to eat at McDonald’s, it’s not hard to come up with a few legitimate reasons not to. The lack of beef in their beef isn’t one of them, though." 2000 "Oct" 10 1990

"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/fallen-like-leaves/" "true" "As the story goes, her father drove his truck into a pile of leaves in which she was playing, killing her." "Barbara Mikkelson" 2006-11-12 "A father drove his truck over a leaf pile containing his daughter, killing her." "In 2006, Snopes received the following email: Hello, I recently was reminded about an urban legend from a friend of mine. We live in northwest Indiana and as the story goes, a family had raked all their fallen leaves into a pile by street. A daughter saw her father driving down their road on his way from work, so she quickly hid in the pile of leaves hoping to jump out of the pile to scare him. What she didn’t count on was that her father had decided to have some fun himself and drive through the pile of leaves. He ran over his daughter and killing her instantly. What might appear to be naught but a cautionary tale extolling the importance of never assuming a pile of leaves doesn’t contain a playful tot or two is in fact a fairly accurate account of an actual tragedy. On the afternoon of Nov. 3, 2004, in the town of Methuen, Massachusetts, 10-year-old Natalie Gravel and 8-year-old Merrideth Reed were playing in a pile of leaves left in the street outside their apartment building. Just before the accident, neighbors saw the girls laughing and shoveling leaves at each other with plastic trash-can lids. At about 5 p.m., Natalie’s father drove his full-size 1997 GMC 1500 pickup over that pile of leaves as he rolled to his accustomed parking spot on the street. James Gravel never saw the two girls playing amidst the fallen autumn foliage, perhaps because they deliberately ducked out of sight in an effort to surprise him and Natalie’s two siblings, who were in the truck with him. The 36-year-old contractor had no idea anything was amiss until he got out of the truck. It was then he discovered the horribly injured girls — his own daughter and the daughter of the woman he lived with, both of whom had been crushed under his front and rear tires.  Natalie died a half-hour later at Holy Family Hospital of massive chest trauma. The last thing her father heard her say as she was loaded into the ambulance was, “I can’t breathe.” Merrideth survived her injuries. Another leaf-pile tragedy played out in Forest Grove, Oregon, in October 2013, when two stepsisters were killed by a car that ran over the curbside pile of leaves in which they were playing: Abigail Robinson, 11, suffered critical injuries and passed away later, at Randall Children’s Hospital in Portland [the following] night. Her 6-year-old stepsister Anna Dieter-Eckerdt died immediately after the two were hit by the vehicle. Police said the girls were playing across the street from their house in a pile of leaves that extended over the curb and into the street. Abigail’s father was taking pictures and had gone back into the house to put away the camera when he heard the crash, police said. Capt. Mike Herb with the Forest Grove Police Department said the driver may not have realized the girls were struck. Monday was “Leaf Day” in the community and leaves were piled high along the streets. Police subsequently arrested the driver of the car, 18-year-old Cinthya Garcia-Cisneros, and her boyfriend, 18-year-old Mario Echeverria. Garcia-Cisneros, who lived three blocks away, acknowledged that she had purposely driven over the leaf pile and then heard a “loud bump”; she was subsequently arrested and charged with two counts of felony hit and run because, after her brother went back to the accident scene and then informed her “that she had ‘run over’ a child,” she did not contact police or notify the victims’ family. A similar incident occurred in Australia in 1992. In that fatal mishap, two children who had been playing in a cardboard box in a vacant lot were crushed by a cement truck delivering a load to a worksite via a commonly-used shortcut across a growing housing development in Banks, a suburb of Canberra. The boy (age seven) and girl (age four) were killed instantly. The family had moved into its new home only the day before.  While such unfortunate events are a rarity, that they happen at all should serve as reason enough to err on the side of caution where vehicles and items large enough to conceal children at play are concerned. Leaf piles attract kids, as do large cardboard boxes. Rather than assume such items are unoccupied and that children would know better than to play in harm’s way, a prudent driver will avoid taking a vehicle across or into them." 2006 "Nov" 11 1500

"David Mikkelson" 2001-04-19 "A website called ManBeef.com authentically advertised real human meat for purchase." "Yes, the ManBeef.com website that sprang to life in 2001 was quite slick and nicely laid out for its time, and chock full of background information, sales pitches, recipes for human meat, and even company T-shirts for sale. Yes, one may even have heard a \"representative\" from ManBeef discussing (through a voice changer, because of the \"death threats\" he claimed he received) their products on a local talk radio program. And yes, it was nothing but a hoax. Cannibalism is undoubtedly the strongest taboo in modern society, and in a country where most people turn up their noses in digust at the thought of eating horsemeat or duck eggs, the sales potential for human meat is negligible. Aside from that pesky marketing problem, however, is the inconvenient fact that it simply isn't legal to sell human flesh for consumption (by other humans or anything else) anywhere in the United States (or to export it out of the USA), no matter how \"fresh\" or carefully packaged it may be. (The recent scares over Mad Cow Disease have led people to object to the practice of feeding livestock ground-up parts of other livestock, so the notion of humans eating other humans just isn't going to fly.) The Food Safety and Inspection Service, under the aegis of the United States Department of Agriculture, is the agency tasked with the inspection of meat sold in or exported from the USA: Under the Federal Meat Inspection Act and the Poultry Products Inspection Act, FSIS inspects all raw meat and poultry sold in interstate and foreign commerce, including imported products. The Agency monitors meat and poultry products after they leave federally inspected plants. In addition, FSIS monitors state inspection programs, which inspect meat and poultry products sold only within the state in which they were produced. The 1967 Wholesome Meat Act and the 1968 Wholesome Poultry Products Act require state inspection programs to be \"at least equal to\" the Federal inspection program. If states choose to end their inspection program or cannot maintain this standard, FSIS must assume responsibility for inspection within that state. When we queried the USDA about the possibility of purchasing a few \"people chops\" from ManBeef.com, they responded: It is definitely a hoax and you are right, it is illegal to sell human meat, by absence of legality. In other words, meat and poultry to be sold must be inspected by a federal authority. For example, to sell beef it must have the USDA inspection seal on it. If that seal is not on the meat, it can't be sold. Food that is not under USDA inspection, like alligator, must be inspected by the FDA. It is illegal for any restaurant or store to sell food without federal inspection. Federal compliance officers routinely inspect restaurants and grocery stores to ensure that the food that they sell has the required inspection stamps on them. Needless to say, neither the FDA nor the USDA does — or ever has — approved the sale of human meat in the USA or its export to other countries. (That latter part puts the kibosh on the ManBeef hoaxsters' dodge that \"the company's main market is Asia and the Middle East.\" In fact, an Arabic newspaper in Sudan was shut down for two days merely for printing an article about ManBeef, a topic considered \"offending to the public taste.\") Of course, pesky facts about the non-legality of selling human meat didn't really cut into ManBeef's \"sales,\" since you couldn't actually order anything from the website (other than T-shirts and coffee mugs) because, they claimed: We do this, because we prefer to deal with our customers on a more personal basis. Because we are so focused on customer service and customer satisfaction, we do not wish to lose all contact with our customers. Because we cater to a select group of clientele, we find it better to deal directly with our customers. We also do not sell products directly off of our website because we would be unable to meet the demand of thousands of orders per day. Because the supply of high quality human meat is limited, we have to limit the number of orders we accept. That's certainly a novel way of doing business: \"We already have more orders than we can handle, so we're going to put up a web site to advertise our product to customers whom we can't service.\" Since the website didn't include a physical address prospective \"customers\" could visit, a mailing address they could write to, or a phone number they could use to order ManBeef's alleged products, one had to wonder just how ManBeef conducted any business at all, let alone business on a \"personal basis.\" If you wanted to \"order\" from ManBeef.com, you had to apply for a \"membership\" on their website, which brought a mail message asking for additional information and informing you that: Once we have this information, we will run a background check on you. By sending in the above information you agree to allow us to have a background check performed. Because ManBeef International Meats can not legally sell any human meat product to anyone with a criminal history, we would like to ask you a couple questions now, before we begin a background check. At least this part was literally, if deceptively, true: They could not \"legally sell any human meat product to anyone with a criminal history\" because they could not legally sell any human meat product to anyone. If you declared yourself to be a non-felon (and swore you didn't associate with felons), you got a message back telling you that a \"background check\" was being run on you. ManBeef got a bit backed up running those \"background checks\" though, so it wasn't advisable to hold one's breath: There are currently ( 91 ) other persons scheduled before you for background checks. The background check generally takes 7 days to process. Your background check is scheduled to begin at the below date: Schedule date: ( May 21, 2001 ) Once the background check has completed we will mail you a copy of our contract. After the signed contract has been mailed back to us, we will mail you the members packet. This packet includes information we do not give out on the website, such as toll free phone numbers for all ManBeef divisions, addresses for ordering and shipping, and special sales. Every packet also includes a 45 minute video tape titled \"ManBeef And You\". This tape covers the basics of human meat cooking, storage, and some interesting human meat tips and tricks. Our \"background check\" date came and went, but we received nothing further from ManBeef — no contract, no information packet, no \"ManBeef And You\" video. What a surprise. Note that the phone number listed for the Technical and the Administrative contact in the domain registration of this \"international\" company's website didn't correspond to the New York address given and traced back to a 16-year-old in Apex, NC, and that said 16-year-old's own domain was established with the very same registrar as ManBeef.com's. Also note that the Binghamton, New York, address listed in the registration was phony: ManBeef had no offices there, and county officials verified that they had no business license on file for a ManBeef International Meats. Eventually, the map showing Binghamton as the home of ManBeef's \"regional headquarters\" disappeared from the ManBeef.com website. What a surprise. In June 2001, ManBeef's sole \"employee\" (and putative \"President\") finally confessed: \"Soon we will be publishing some pages on our website stating that manbeef is in fact a joke.\" Alas, that promise also turned out to be hoax. Update: As of 2005, ManBeef.com became a porn site and the hoax site moved to a different URL, though it didn't last long there either. Courtesy of the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine, you can still browse the original ManBeef site as it existed in 2001. Bon appetit!" 2001 "Apr" 4 1960

"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/spunkball/" "false" "Horribly spelled warnings about homicidal teens playing \"spunkball\" began turning up on the internet in 2000." "Barbara Mikkelson" 2000-03-01 "Teens across the U.S.A. are amusing themselves by throwing lit gasoline-soaked rags into cars halted at stop lights." "Obviously, we don't think our world frightening enough because someone out there keeps inventing a stream of wild tales about non-existent lurking dangers. This time around it's heartless gangs of fun-loving teenagers who are out to get us (which is a refreshing change from what's come to be scarelore's usual spectre of evil, street gangs). One such example included this one, which was collected on the internet in 2000: I just wanted to warn all of my friends about something that has been occuring more and more lately, all through out the country. Groups of teenagers have been caught, in alarming numbers, playing a new and dangerous game called Spunkball. Spunkball consists of a group of teens in a car pulling up to a stop light, and looking around for a car stopped near by with an open window. When one is spotted, the teens shout, \"Spunkball\", and throw a gasoline soaked rag that has been wrapped in aluminum foil threw the open window. On the outside of the foil is attatched a small fire cracker, with the fuse lit. When the fire cracker explodes, it shreds the foil, and the rag is ignited, causing a large flame that may catch the interior of the car on fire. Spunkball playing has already claimed two lives, caused uncountable injuries due to burns, and caused thousands of dollars in damage to automobiles. The best defense, say authorities, is to keep all windows rolled up when stopped at traffic lights, as only cars with windows down are being targeted. If you are at a redlight and hear a shout \"Spunkball\", and notice something come flying in your window, the best thing to do is to have all passengers immediatly exit the vehichle. DO NOT try to retreive the object, as it will ignite once the fire cracker explodes. PLEASE PASS THIS ON TO EVERYONE YOU CARE ABOUT. Versions circulating in 2004 added a header indicating that the warning was an \"Important Message from Allstate Insurance Company — For Your Information.\" Horribly spelled warnings about homicidal teens playing \"spunkball\" began turning up on the Internet in February 2000 (and, since no good hoax is allowed to go to waste when there are new netizens yet to be japed, the phony Spunkball warning was dusted off and recirculated in March 2002). There's nothing to the alert, however — no stories have appeared in the press to support the claim that even one such incident has occurred, let alone that there's a nationwide epidemic underway. Likewise, there are no reports of any spunkball-related deaths. Consider yourself safe from such a menace and feel free to leave your car windows down at red lights. In February 2002, new life was breathed into the then two-year-old baseless scare when its text appeared over the signature line of \"Bea Maggio, FCLS, Allstate Insurance Co.\" This small improvement added the layer of credibility needed to make this warning far more plausible in the eyes of many. Now it appeared the warning had been vetted by a powerful insurance agency, which was now disseminating the information in an effort to alert motorists who were at risk. Bea Maggio hadn't been acting in an official capacity on behalf of Allstate — she's merely done what so many are prone to do, which was unthinkingly forward to others an e-mail she'd received. Hers was not an official heads up from Allstate, but a note from an individual who, by pure coincidence, happened to work for an insurance company. Okay, so spunkball is not real — does this mean bored teens in search of amusing pastimes are incapable of that level of mindless violence and lack of concern for human life? Not at all, as a news story out of Darmstadt, Germany, so vividly illustrates. Three American teenage boys were arrested for hurling large stones (some of them weighing 20 lbs.) from a pedestrian bridge at cars travelling on the four-lane highway underneath on 27 February 2000. Their actions caused the deaths of two people (one a 20-year-old woman driving her grandmother home and the other a 41-year-old mother of two small children) and sent a further five victims to the hospital (including the grandmother of the murdered woman). The teens (age 14, 17, and 18) will be tried in German courts on charges of murder and attempted murder. A fourth (15) was arrested but later released once it became clear he'd left the bridge before the rock hurling began. If convicted under Germany's juvenile justice laws, the teens could be sentenced to a maximum of 10 years in a German youth facility. With real stories like that, who needs fake ones?

"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/fire-screen/" "false" "Photographs purportedly show the aftermath of a car fire caused by a GPS device." "David Mikkelson" 2014-11-20 "Photographs show the aftermath of a car fire caused by an overheated GPS device." "In May 2012, photographs displayed to be circulated along with the claim that the pictured car's damage was the result of a fire caused by an overheated windshield-mounted GPS unit. That car fire was supposed to have been touched off by the sun's rays igniting the unit's battery. In October 2009 these same photos were being circulated on the Internet under the claim of their documenting a car fire caused by an iPhone charger. At that time the blaze was attributed to the hardwired electrical device plug-in now commonly found in new vehicles, with the unstated cause being a short in that automobile's outlet. When the photos reappeared in May 2012, they did so attached to a tale about an overheated battery-operated device (a Garmin GPS) left in a vehicle at the Naval Air Weapons Station in China Lake, California. In that instance of these photos' use, the cause of the fire was attributed to the stand-alone device (specifically the battery it contained) rather than any permanent part of the vehicle itself. We don't know what touched off the fire that destroyed the vehicle (which does indeed appear to be a 2007 Suburban) shown in those much-traveled photos. However, the photographs themselves demonstrate a windshield-mounted GPS unit couldn't have been to blame:  The second and third photos rule out that cause. To the immediate left of the worst of the damage, both display a relatively untouched dash-installed GPS system. Beyond the presence of that unit's making it highly questionable the vehicle would contain a second (windshield-mounted) GPS, the burn pattern argues for the fire's point of origin being just to the right of the central area of the control panel or the floor-mounted console immediately beneath that. (Fire burns upwards, thus a blaze that began on a windshield-mounted device wouldn't have done relatively little damage to the windshield underneath it, then reached down to devastate the center of that vehicle's control panel.) It is worth noting, however, that in at least one real-life instance an overheated GPS was pointed to as the cause of fairly serious vehicular damage. In February 2012, a Ford F350 left parked overnight in Paducah, Kentucky, was discovered the next morning with everything left of its steering wheel melted, its left visor and the ceiling above it scorched almost beyond recognition, and its windshield blown outward where its Garmin GPS had been mounted. Notice, however, this explosion took place at night, thus neither the sun's direct rays nor the truck's cabin having been turned into a hotbox by the day's heat was to blame. Also, in 2010 Garmin recalled its Nuvi 750, 760 and 765 GPS devices because their batteries could overheat and lead to a fire. This recall affected Nissan, Volvo, and Suzuki owners. Examples of this viral anecdote are shown below: [Collected via e-mail, November 2014] Feel free to pass this along to anyone you want. Better safe than sorry. GPS left on dashboard in the sun - WOW! Keep those electronics with Lithium Batteries out of the sun!!!!!!!! Looks like a good lesson to learn. I would bet this also applies to Cell phones, tablets, digital cameras, and other devices that use lithium batteries. You think this may be a reason why the US Postal Service will not ship electronic devices that contain lithium batteries any longer? GPS was placed in its bracket in the windshield and left in the sun. The battery overheated and exploded! Can you say \"Totaled\"?
<!-- [Collected via e-mail, June 2012] GPS Battery Explosion If you have a portable GPS. FYI Don't leave your GPS attached to your windshield in the summer....

"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/overcharged/" "mostly false" "A viral TikTok video claimed \"electric waves\" from the outlet \"will come through your body.\" That's misleading." "Barbara Mikkelson" 2014-10-07 "Using a cell phone while it is being recharged poses a serious threat of electrocution." "Cell phone users generally do not risk serious electrocution if, or when, they use devices while they're charging. However, some low-quality chargers or faulty batteries could represent a small risk of electrocution, burns, or fire, as reported by Agence France-Presse. For nearly two decades, the Snopes newsroom has received questions from readers about a rumor that using a charging cell phone — whether for calls, texts, social media scrolling, or so on — puts the user at risk of electrocution. The inquiries were a response to messages, like the one in a viral TikTok video, supposedly warning cell phone users of the threat.  In the TikTok video, a narrator supposedly uses a voltage stick to gauge the \"power\" — or voltage — circulating between the outlet, phone charger, device, and a user. \"If someone is talking on the phone while the phone is charging, the electric waves will come through your body,\" the narrator claimed, while the voltage stick lit up to supposedly show the cell phone user's energy levels change with the device plugged in. But, as Eric Yeatman, head of Imperial College London’s Electrical and Electronic Engineering department, told Agence France-Presse (AFP) in 2021, while it was possible the voltage stick indeed detected \"tiny amounts\" of energy traveling between the outlet and the cell phone user, that level of low voltage was \"generally harmless.\" Also, he said, other handheld appliances or devices would do the same thing. “A phone charger has a unit at the wall end that converts dangerous mains voltage to harmless low voltage DC which travels along the lead and into your phone,” Yeatman told AFP. “This is true for anything you hold while it’s plugged into the wall, like a kitchen hand blender.\" Andrew Wood, who chairs the Department of Health and Medical Sciences at Swinburne University of Technology in Melbourne, told the news outlet that a voltage stick like the one in the video would also react to a balloon that had been rubbed fabric. Furthermore, the World Health Organization said “current evidence does not confirm the existence of any health consequences from exposure to low level electromagnetic fields” like those detected by the voltage stick. The TikTok video was just the latest iteration of the cell phone rumor, which, for years, appeared in emails to Snopes asking whether there was any credibility behind warnings to avoid using the devices while they're chargin. In September 2004, for instance, someone shared with us the following message: Dear All, I send this message to make you aware of the danger potential of the commonly used cellular phone. A few days ago, this following person was recharging his cellphone at home. Just at that time a call came and he attended to that call with the instrument still connected to the mains. After a few seconds electricity flowed into the cellphone unrestrained and the young man was thrown to the ground with a heavy thud. His parents rushed to the room only to find him unconscious, with weak heartbeats and burnt fingers. He was rushed to the nearby hospital, but was pronounced dead on arrival. Cellphone is a very useful modern invention. However, we must be aware that it can also be an instrument of death. Never use the cellphone while it is hooked to the mains! This is my humble plea. Then, three years later, in November 2007, Snopes received this email including images supposedly showing the aftermath of a deadly cell phone explosion: READ THIS!!!! IMPORTANT FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI HOSPITAL ….VERY SERIOUS WARNING… Please beware and be fore-warned. Even though I always knew that this is a dangerous habit, I must confess that I had sub-consciously practiced it in the past, so this is also a wake-up call to myself. Be safe and be blessed. Never, ever answer a cell phone while it is being RECHARGED!! A few days ago, a person was recharging his cell phone at home. Just at that time a call Came in and he answered it with the instrument still connected to the outlet. After a few seconds electricity flowed into the cellphone unrestrained and the young man was thrown to the ground with a heavy thud. As you can
see, the phone actually exploded. His parents rushed to the room only to find him unconscious, with a weak heartbeat and burnt fingers. He was rushed to the nearby hospital, but was pronounced dead on arrival. Cell phones are a very useful modern invention. However, we must be aware that it can also be an instrument of death. Later, in August 2013, a reader sent this to Snopes: Pass 2 all your contacts. Today again a boy died in Mumbai, Bcoz of attending a call while his mobile was at charge. That time he had sudden vibration 2 his heart & fingers were burnt. So pls don’t attend calls while charging ur cel. Pls pas this 2 al whom u care. 1 USEFUL MSG IS BETER than MANY jokes..

 Different iterations of that rumor — someone in recent days supposedly died from an exploding cell phone, or electrocution as a result of the device charging — described the deceased in a variety of ways, including \"a close relative\" of the message's author. Based on our research, the emails appeared to be retellings of an Aug. 11, 2004, news story out of Chavara, India. According to articles by the Press Trust of India (a news agency) and the New Indian Express (a newspaper), a man named K. Viswajith was electrocuted when he answered his cell phone while it was plugged in for recharging. The news articles contained no information about the type of cell phone or what caused it to electrocute its owner. Similar reports of cell phones supposedly exploding, starting fires or electrocuting their users also made news in 2004, including: Worldwide, a number of cells exploded the year prior, in 2003, a great many of them Nokia phones. According to Nokia, third-party or counterfeit batteries were to blame: In each and every exploding phone case it investigated, the battery in question proved not to be original to the unit and not to have included industry-standard safety measures. Nokia also found the vast majority of short circuits that led to these explosions were caused by the units having undergone traumatic events (such as being dropped) that jeopardized the integrity of poorly-manufactured batteries. The stories continued after that. In 2013, the Chinese news agency Xinhua reported that a 23-year-old woman from the Xinjiang region had been electrocuted when she took a call on iPhone 5 while it was being charged. Information about that case was scant and whether the incident actually took place as reported was not confirmed. All of this said, the practice of using a recharging cell phone does not in itself pose a serious danger. Rather, the quality of the phone's battery or charger could represent a small risk.

Manufacturing standards vary from country to country, so it should not be assumed all cell phones are built to the same specifications no matter where they come from, or that the quality of workmanship is consistent across the board. In lands where regulations regarding how safe electronics must be before they are allowed on the market are more lax, or where enforcement of those laws is haphazard, defective units that could prove dangerous to their users are far more likely to get into the hands of consumers. Citing Yeatman, of Imperial College London, AFP wrote: 'If you have a cheap knock-off charger then the mains leakage is likely higher, but still not causing you any harm unless it fails completely, in which case you could be electrocuted,' Yeatman said. He said he was not aware of that ever happening. 'The bigger danger from cheap chargers is that they fail and catch fire,' said Yeatman. Costas Constantinou, Professor of Communication Electrodynamics at the University of Birmingham said by email that the only theoretical danger is 'if the integrated battery pack of the mobile phone was damaged it would present an elevated burn hazard during charging.' He added there are well-documented instances of the potential fire hazard posed by lithium-ion batteries, the ones used in mobile phones, 'but those have absolutely nothing to do with the erroneous claims of the post in question.' In sum, while some low-quality chargers or faulty batteries could represent a small risk of dangerous malfunctions, cell phone users generally do not need to fear electrocution if, or when, they use devices while they're charging. For those reasons, we rated this claim \"Mostly False.\"" 2014 "Oct" 10 2000

"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/cow-blood-chocolate-milk/" "false" "Chocolate milk is not made from \"regular\" milk that was rejected for containing too much cow's blood." "Barbara Mikkelson" 2001-03-05 "Chocolate milk is made from \"regular\" milk rejected for containing too much cow's blood." "The belief that yucky things lurk in the depths of dark-colored liquids is a widespread food fear. Blood is generally considered icky, so schoolchildren regularly horrify each other with whispered claims that the milk used in chocolate milk is just swimming with the stuff. Now that prepared coffee beverages are making it to the supermarket shelves we're seeing this particular tale expand to include those products, thereby broadening the age range of this rumor's audience. (The belief that cow's blood is to be scrupulously avoided at all costs is suspended in our dealings with meat products. No one recoils in horror at the thought that a steak or a hamburger contains cow's blood — our beef with ingesting blood apparently stops at the fork.) In the U.S., the Food and Drug Administration oversees the safety of food products. Stringent standards have been established for all milk destined for consumers, including the chocolate variety. It is telling that this agency's specifications contain no allowances for the use of blood-contaminated milk. Milk products (and other foodstuffs) that do not meet the agency's criteria do not gain FDA approval and thus cannot be sold to consumers. In other words, the \"cow's blood in the chocolate milk\" story doesn't fly any better than a cow would. A similar version of this rumor which claimed to show \"what cow's milk looks like before they whiten it\" was circulated on social media in 2017:   Although this image is genuine, it doesn't show the \"real color of cow's milk\" before it gets whitened. This image was taken from a 2013 video from the \"Funky Farmer\", and it shows the milk produced by a cow that had recently given birth. In fact, farmer Richard Cornock explicitly states in the following video that the red color doesn't happen very often, and that the pictured milk is \"not fit for human consumption\": \"In this case on the left we have a lot of blood in the milk. It doesn't happen often like that but occasionally you get blood in the milk because maybe there's a blood vessel burst in the udder or something. That always comes right in the end. Might take a week of milking. But as you can see it's not fit for human consumption. So we have to keep that out at the end.\"  <!--

"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/last-call/" "false" "We've seen such claims circulating online since at least 2007." "David Mikkelson" 2011-06-23 "Cell phone calls from particular phone numbers cause brain hemorrhage and death." "Claims of potentially fatal phone calls have been circulating via email and internet rumor since 2007, and they persist despite the lack of hard evidence about where these supposed deaths occurred. Adding to the fear-mongering are the area codes these phone calls supposedly originate from, which correspond to Middle Eastern countries (most notably Iran and Afghanistan). One such example read: Hi Colleagues, I don’t know how true this is but just take precaution. Please don’t attend to any calls from the following numbers: * 7888308001 *
* 9316048121 *
* 9876266211 *
* 9888854137 *
* 9876715587 * These numbers come in red colors. U may get brain hemorrhage due to high frequency. 27 persons died just receiving the calls watch the DD news to confirm. Please inform all your relatives and friends soon it's urgent.  Another example the Snopes newsroom came across stated: Hi All, Its very important news for all of you. Do not pick up calls Under given numbers. 9888308001 , 9316048121 91+, 9876266211, 9888854137, 9876715587 These numbers will come in red color, if the calls comes up from these numbers. Its with very high wave length, and frequency. If a call is received on mobile from these numbers, it creates a very high frequency and it causes brain ham range. It's not a joke rather, its TRUE. 27 persons died just on receiving calls from these numbers. Watch Aaj Tak (NEWS), DD News and IBN 7. Forward this message to all u'r friends and colleagues, and relatives While it might seem that this canard combines an assumed fear of people of Middle Eastern descent with rumors that cell phones can somehow cause tissue damage, the fiction's origins are actually in the Middle East itself. In fact, this warning appears to have started in Pakistan in 2007, spreading first to Afghanistan and then to other countries. It is simply not possible for cell phones to transmit at frequencies that would cause immediate fatalities. This legend depends on a misunderstanding of how frequency waves and resonance work. Sound waves and vibrations can be destructive (consider sound waves breaking glass or the destruction of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge), but circumstances have to be very precise for this to happen. (The University of Salford explains how to replicate the glass shattering effect with sound waves). One key element is volume: without enough volume, sound waves simply do not vibrate glass hard enough to cause destruction. Since cell phones have a limited volume range, this affects their ability to cause damage to the brain. Cell phone frequencies range from 698 to 2155 MhZ, not even enough to pop popcorn. There is still no solid evidence cell phones can even produce wavelengths that cause damage to the human body, most notably in the form of cancer-causing radiation. The National Cancer Institute's web page on cell phones states that \"Research studies have not shown a consistent link between cell phone use and cancer. A large international study (Interphone) published in 2010 found that, overall, cell phone users have no increased risk for two of the most common types of brain tumor.\" The final bit of this legend that is questionable is the \"red number\" display. With the exception of user customization on some smart phones, incoming calls are always displayed in black — callers cannot change settings on someone else's phone simply by dialing their number. Despite the complete implausibility, these rumors continue to circulate, seen more recently in Kenya in late 2010. Part of this persistence was fueled by a June 2004 hoax letter, purportedly from a Nokia executive to his staff, claiming that the rumors are true and that \"energy surges into [the user's] body, resulting in both coronary heart failure and brain hemorrhage.\" In 2005, Nokia issued a statement refuting the contents of the letter. A spokesman for Nokia said: \"Like many other claims circulating on the internet, this is a hoax.\" \"The letter has absolutely nothing to do with Nokia. We regret any inconvenience caused to our customers by this work of fiction.\" The bogus letter also claims all other mobile phone manufacturers are affected by the same problem. It says it is an inherent fault in the system design and cannot be resolved. Addressed To All Staff and stamped 'confidential', the letter has been made to look like it has been leaked from within the company — but the word haemorrhaging is spelt incorrectly.

"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/finger-food/" "false" "A Wendy's customer was said to have found a human finger in her bowl of chili." "David Mikkelson" 2005-03-24 "A Wendy's customer found a human finger in her bowl of chili." "Claims of human body parts turning up in food products are the most horrifying of contaminated food legends, both because of our very strong societal taboo against the eating of human flesh, and because such a discovery suggests a human death, almost certainly one that was accidental rather than natural (and which conjures up images of a slow and painful death by industrial accident), or at least a painful dismemberment. Fortunately, improved health and safety standards in food processing make such occurrences quite rare, and most reports of consumers finding body parts in food turn out to be hoaxes, frauds perpetrated to extort money from businesses, or cases of mistaken identity. (In the latter case, something that looks like a human body is often found, upon examination by experts, to be something else entirely. See, for example, our page about a scare involving a finger supposedly found in a can of menudo.) In March 2005, the news media were once again full of reports that such a grisly discovery had been made. On the evening of March 22, 2005, Anna Ayala, a 39-year-old resident of Las Vegas was dining at a San Jose outlet of the Wendy's fast food restaurant chain when she discovered what appeared to be a human finger in her bowl of chili. According to the San Jose Mercury News: Devina Cordero, 20, was with her boyfriend at the fast food restaurant when she said the woman, who has not been identified, began gasping and ran up to her saying: \"Don't eat it! Look, there's a human finger in our chili.\" Cordero said the object appeared cooked and seemed to have a long fingernail at the end. All three people soon became sick. \"We went up to the counter and they told us it was a vegetable,\" Cordero said. \"The people from Wendy's were poking it with a spoon.\" [San Jose police officer Enrique] Garcia said the Santa Clara County Health Department is taking over the investigation. \"It was some sort of small mass which appeared to have a fingernail. It's a small piece,\" Garcia said. \"They collected the finger and placed it in a freezer for the health department.\" The following day, Santa Clara County health officials confirmed the object found in the bowl of Wendy's chili was indeed a human finger (about 1-1/2 inches long and containing part of a manicured nail). Investigators quickly ruled out the possibility that the digit formerly belonged to an employee of the San Jose Wendy's outlet, but they were unable to trace it to its original owner via fingerprint or DNA matching. Wendy's offered a $50,000 reward for information on the origin of the finger as sales at Wendy's outlets (particularly in the San Francisco-San Jose bay area) dropped off significantly in the weeks following the incident. Meanwhile, suspicions that Ms. Ayala's discovery may not have been \"accidental\" were aroused when she quickly retained a lawyer; those suspicions were heightened when San Jose and Las Vegas police executed a search warrant at her home, and when the news broke that she had a litigious history which included claims against another fast-food chain, a former employer, and General Motors. (Her family had received a settlement several years earlier after her daughter was sickened at an El Pollo Loco restaurant in Las Vegas.) Rumors spread that the finger may have come from Ms. Ayala's dead aunt, but she denied that she even had a dead aunt. The case took a few more intriguing turns in mid-April. First Ms. Ayala announced (shortly after the news about her previous lawsuits broke) that she would not pursue legal action against Wendy's because her claim had \"caused her great emotional distress and continue[d] to be difficult emotionally.\" Then attention focused on Sandy Allman, a 59-year-old woman from Pahrump (a town about 60 miles west of Las Vegas), who had lost a fingertip when she was attacked by a leopard one month before the Wendy's incident. The fingertip could not be reattached; Ms. Allman last saw it packed in ice in a Las Vegas emergency room, and neither she nor the hospital could account for what had become of it. Ms. Allman offered to submit to DNA testing to identify whether the finger supposedly found in the bowl of Wendy's chili was hers, but a match was doubtful in light of news reports that her lost fingertip was only half as long as the one Anna Ayala claimed to have found. On 15 April 2005, Wendy's increased its reward for information on the case to $100,000. On April 21, 2005, Anna Ayala was arrested by Las Vegas police on charges of attempted grand larceny pertaining to the Wendy's case. Police later determined the mysterious finger Ayala claimed to have found in a bowl of chili came from an associate of her husband's, who lost his fingertip when it was severed in the tailgate of a truck during a work accident at an asphalt maintenance company and evidently gave the digit to a co-worker to settle a $50 debt. In September 2005 Ayala and her husband, Jaime Placencia, pled guilty to conspiring to file a false claim and attempted grand theft. In January 2006, Ayala was sentenced to nine years in prison and Placencia to twelve (but Ayala was later re-sentenced to only four years after a successful appeal based on a technical sentencing error). In June 2013, Anna Ayala pled guilty to charges of being an accessory to a felony, filing a false police report, and being a felon in possession of a firearm for attempting to hide the fact that her son had accidentally shot himself in the ankle with a gun he was not allowed to possess because he was on parole, instead blaming two other men for the shooting.

"David Mikkelson" 2001-07-23 "A man was burned to death attempting to rescue his friend's dog from a boiling hot spring." "Self-preservation is one of the most powerful instincts a human being — or any animal — possesses. Human intelligence gives us the ability to detect dangers other creatures may not perceive, but it also endows us with emotions that can sometimes overpower our rational judgment. When someone near and dear to us — a spouse, a child, a beloved pet — is threatened, our impulse to act in aid can overcome our instinct for self-preservation and lead us to confront death in ways we would never otherwise conceive. The tale that follows is one example of this phenomenon, concerning a man who died in one of the most gruesome ways imaginable in an attempt to rescue a friend's dog. The hot springs found in abundance throughout Yellowstone National Park's thermal areas are bubbling cauldrons of steam and boiling water, most of them hotter than 150°F, and many of them in the 185°-205°F range. (Due to the elevation, water boils at about 198° in Yellowstone.) Twenty-two scalding deaths have been recorded in connection with Yellowstone's hot springs since 1870, all of them known or believed to have involved people who inadvertently fell into the springs through accident or carelessness — save one. On 20 July 1981, 24-year-old David Alan Kirwan from La Cañada, California, was driving through Yellowstone's Fountain Paint Pot thermal area with his friend Ronald Ratliff and Ratliff's dog Moosie. At about 1:00 P.M. they parked their truck to get out and take a closer look at the hot springs; Moosie escaped from the truck, ran towards nearby Celestine Pool (a thermal spring whose water temperature has been measured at over 200°), jumped in, and began yelping. Kirwan and Ratliff rushed over to the pool to aid the terrified dog, and Kirwan's attitude indicated he was about to go into the spring after it. According to bystanders, several people tried to warn Kirwan off by yelling at him not to jump in, but he shouted \"Like hell I won't!\" back at them, took two steps into the pool, and then dove head-first into the boiling spring. Kirwan swam out to the dog and attempted to take it to shore; he then disappeared underwater, let go of the dog, and tried to climb out of the pool. Ratliff helped pull Kirwan out of the hot spring (resulting in second-degree burns to his own feet), and another visitor led Kirwan to the sidewalk as he reportedly muttered, \"That was stupid. How bad am I? That was a stupid thing I did.\" Kirwan was indeed in very bad shape. He was blind, and when another park visitor tried to remove one of his shoes, his skin (which was already peeling everywhere) came off with it. He sustained third-degree burns to 100% of his body, including his head, and died the following morning at a Salt Lake City hospital. (Moosie did not survive, either.) Perhaps David Alan Kirwan didn't realize just how hot the thermal springs really are, perhaps he didn't consider the deadly effect submersion in water of such temperatures would have on him, or perhaps blind emotion drove him to act without taking even the briefest moment to consider his own safety. Foolish, brave, rash, or otherwise, can any of us imagine a circumstance, no matter how dire, under which we would willingly dive head-first into a pool of boiling water? Yet another (non-fatal) incident of this type occurred in Yellowstone in 2001 when a 39-year-old tourist from Washington state entered a thermal pool in an attempt to rescue a dog which had bolted from his family's motor home and jumped into the scalding waters. The man was fortunate to have suffered only second-degree burns and was released from the hospital the next day. On 10 October 2014, another man was hospitalized in Reno after he jumped into a hot spring at Black Rock Desert in an effort to save a dog from the scalding waters: Firefighters received a call at about 4 p.m. of a man jumping into the Double Hot Springs at Black Rock Desert, Fire Chief Willard Gooch said. The man was taken to Renown Regional Medical Center via Care Flight, Gooch said. The extent of his injuries was not immediately known. \"There's three (hot springs) that's out there that you can get pretty burned from,\" Gooch said. \"There are several out there that people need to pay attention to.\" The hot springs at Black Rock Desert can be streams or deep ponds of boiling water, he said. The Double Hot Springs reach about 180 degrees with very steep and slippery banks, according to the Friends of Black Rock High Rock. Although the area around the springs is fenced, dogs have been known to jump into or drink from the springs, the Friends of Black Rock said on the organization's website. It [is not yet] known what type of dog jumped in the hot spring, whether the man owned it or if it survived the scalding hot water. Although no dog was involved, the June 2016 death of a Portland, Oregon, man who wandered off the designated path at Yellowstone National Park and fell into the water near Noris Basin Geyser made headlines because of its gruesome and unusual nature. The man's sister -- who was walking with him at the time and saw him fall in -- contacted authorities immediately, but due to the heat and acidity of the water, they were unable to find his remains." 2001 "Jul" 7 1870

"Barbara Mikkelson" 1999-02-27 "Films are routinely made for entertainment purposes in which participants are murdered on camera." "All the fretting about it aside, not so much as one snuff film has been found. Time and again, what is originally decried in the press as a film of a murder turns out, upon further investigation, to be a fake. Police on three continents routinely investigate films brought to them, and so far this has always been their verdict. No snuff films. Some clever fakes, yes. But no real product. (Al Goldstein, publisher of Screw magazine, has a standing offer of $1 million for anyone who can come up with a commercially sold snuff film. That offer has been in place for years. No one has yet laid claim to it.) It's not enough to fear there might be one snuff film out there; the belief runs strong that a large creation and distribution network is in operation, with children and young people routinely kidnapped then killed while the cameras roll to meet demand and the films of same circulated through this underground to connoisseurs of the genre. The prurience of human nature being what it is, it's not unreasonable to assume if the films existed, there would be those willing to pay to have them. This assumption lies at the heart of the belief that the distribution network is in place. However, fears that a market for such offerings exists are unfounded; even if the market did exist, the product to satisfy it is not there. Hence, there's no market. Each of the following four elements contributes to the belief that snuff films exist: What with all of these elements being interwoven into the fabric of current society as tightly as they are, it's close to impossible for any rational person to conclude snuff films don't exist. Offhand references to them pop up everywhere. Indeed, the genre for this group of videos even has a name, one we casually invoke the same way we would speak of \"horror\" films or \"romantic comedies\" — could something we speak of so confidently be a chimera? And yet, that is exactly the case. Capturing a murder on film would be foolhardy at best. Only the most deranged would consider preserving for a jury a perfect video record of a crime he could go to the executioner for. Even if he stays completely out of the camera's way, too much of who the killer is, how the murder was carried out, and where it took place would be part of such a film, and these details would quickly lead police to the right door. Though someone whose mania has caused him to lose touch with reality might skip over this point, those who are supposedly in the business for the money would be all too aware of this. It doesn't make sense to flirt with the electric chair for the profits derived from a video. Let's start by defining the term and locating its origin, then move on to examine some high-profile films often believed to contain snuff footage, and finish with an examination of the serial killers \"souvenir of the kill\" angle. As to what is or is not a snuff film, according to Kerekes and Slater, authors of Killing for Culture, the bible on the snuff film rumor: Snuff films depict the killing of a human being — a human sacrifice (without the aid of special effects or other trickery) perpetuated for the medium of film and circulated amongst a jaded few for the purpose of entertainment. It's a simple definition, but a workable one. Some will further claim that a profit motive must exist, that the final product has to be offered for sale (as opposed to being passed around without charge within a select circle, or remaining solely in the possession of its maker). That detail is extraneous. It's the recording of the death itself which constitutes the \"snuff\" in snuff films, not who makes a buck out of it. Likewise, claims that the filmmaker must have had no other motivation than the production of the film should be dismissed. A psychopath who tortures and murders solely to satisfy his personal demons but who videotapes the event to create a reliveable record of the experience has produced a snuff film. Unbelievably, the term was coined during the furor arising from the Manson Family murders of 1969. On 9 August 1969, Sharon Tate and four others were butchered by members of Charles Manson's \"Family.\" The next night, a married couple in a neighborhood far distant from that of the Tate residence were slaughtered in similar fashion by the same group. Manson and four of his followers were brought to trial in June, 1970, found guilty of the murders, and sentenced to die. Their sentences were later commuted to life in prison when the death penalty was abolished in 1972. Reinstatement of the death penalty in 1977 did not affect the revised sentences as re-sentencing them (or any of the other inmates whose death sentences had been commuted to life during the \"no death penalty\" phase) to the original penalty was deemed \"cruel and unusual.\" Manson died in prison in 2017. Numerous books were written about the Family, their practices, and the murders they took part in. The best known is Vincent Bugliosi's 1974 Helter Skelter. However, it is towards Ed Sanders' 1971 The Family: The Story of Charles Manson's Dune Buggy Attack Battalion to which we turn. In it, Sanders relates that the Family may have been involved in the making of \"brutality\" (or as he later terms them, \"snuff\") films. This was the first recorded use of the term. Pausing for a moment to deal with the rumor raised about Manson and snuff films, Family members stole an NBC-TV truck loaded with film equipment sometime during the summer of 1969. The truck was later dumped and most of the film given away, but Manson kept one of the NBC cameras. The Family were also said to be in possession of three Super-8 cameras and to have used them to make homegrown porn films. The snuff film allegation comes from Sander's interview with an anonymous one-time member of the Family in which Sanders hears about a \"short movie depicting a female victim dead on a beach.\" ANON: I, I, I knew, I know, I only know about one snuff movie. I, uh, you know —
SANDERS: Which snuff movie do you know about?
ANON: I just know like a young chick maybe about 27, short hair... yeah... and chopped her head off, that was...
SANDERS: What did the girl look like? What was the scenario?
ANON: What was what?
SANDERS: What was the scenario? Was she tied up? Did she look willing?
ANON: She was dead. She was just lying there.
SANDERS: She was already dead?
ANON: Yeah. Legs spread, uh. She was nude but nobody was fucking her. They said her head was just chopped off and she was just laying there. (At this point the interviewee acknowledged he hadn't actually seen the film himself but was instead relating a story he'd heard.) From this fanciful beginning, the term \"snuff\" came to be used to identify films of this nature. As for Manson and the NBC camera, police seized the last of the stolen equipment — consisting of a camera loaded with unexposed film — during a 10 October 1969 raid on Spahn Ranch. In later editions of The Family, Sanders admits no films depicting actual murder or murder victims have surfaced. A 1984 film called Family Movies is sometimes mistaken for home movies of the Family, but all of its characters are friends of the director, John Aes-Nihil. In 1976 the movie Snuff caused a tremendous stir when the word hit the street that an actual film depicting the on-screen murder of an actress had been smuggled into the States from South America, and this was it. Widely-believed hype aside, the film's origin was much more mundane. Snuff was a product of Monarch Releasing Corporation and had been filmed in Argentina in 1971 as Slaughter, a film about bad girls, motorcycles, and bad guys. Slaughter was so ineptly made as to be unreleasable. Five years later, the head of Monarch breathed new life into this terrible piece by splicing on five minutes of additional footage, releasing it as Snuff, and spreading the word this was an actual snuff film. People were horrified, sickened, titillated, outraged... and they went to see it, shelling out the ticket price without argument. Possibly the most famous of all films pointed to as \"snuff\" is the Faces Of Death series, a sequence of six videos made up of footage of accidents, suicides, autopsies, and executions, liberally peppered with outright fake scenes. Most of the actual death scenes shown in these films are of the post-death variety. The multiple camera angles give away the acted-out nature of many of the most compelling scenes. Early in 1991, a film of Asian origin rumored to contain actual snuff footage came into the possession of actor Charlie Sheen. Sheen turned it over to the FBI, quite convinced he'd stumbled onto the real thing, and heartily sickened by what he'd seen. The film in question was Flower of Flesh and Blood, part of a series of films collectively known as \"Guinea Pig.\" Some of the \"Guinea Pig\" films have at least temporarily fooled the authorities, fueling news stories about the unearthing of snuff films. It's no wonder either; the special effects are very cleverly executed. Flower of Flesh and Blood is the episode which stirs much of the controversy. It features a samurai torturing then dismembering a captive girl until she eventually expires in front of the cameras. It wasn't real. According to The San Francisco Chronicle: The FBI confiscated Sheen's tape and proceeded to investigate all involved, including Charles Balun, an early distributor of the film. Balun fiercely asserted that the film was a hoax and was merely a series of startling special effects. Propitiously, the Japanese took this time to release ''Guinea Pig Two: The Making of Guinea Pig One,'' revealing the technical sleight of hand in all its bone-cracking glory. After viewing this film, the FBI backed off and dropped the investigation. In a stunning display of bad taste, this film was shown on San Francisco's public access channel in October 1996. As serial killers are apprehended and brought to trial, it is not uncommon for the \"snuff film rumor\" to surface about the murders they committed. Perhaps these whispers are born of an attempt to explain the inexplicable, to make some sense of that which is beyond the abilities of most of us to grasp. It's at least a motive we've a chance of understanding. Almost every time the rumor arises, there's utterly nothing to it other than the public's attempt to make sense of a monster. Rumors spring up, swirl around for a while, then disappear as the evidence to support them fails to materialize and the public's fevered imagination is captured by newer, more horrific events. Yet every now and then, there's at least a little bit of fire lurking beneath all that generated smoke. Such is the case with the murders committed by Charles Ng and Leonard Lake and with those perpetuated by Paul Bernardo (aka Paul Teale) and Karla Homolka. For both of those murderous pairings, videotape of the victims featured prominently, both in the investigations and at trial. Not videotapes of the murders though — videotape of the victims while they were still alive. One other deadly pair deserves mention: Lawrence Bittaker and Roy Norris. You'll soon see why. In northern California, during a span of eight months in 1984 and 1985, Leonard Lake and Charles Ng murdered more victims than the police can even now properly count up. Next to the cabin Lake lived in, seven bodies and 45 pounds of bones and ash scattered across a 2-acre Calaveras County compound were discovered. More bodies were uncovered over time, but the police don't believe they've found all of them. They conservatively estimate the pair's body count at upwards of 20 victims. Lake and Ng kidnapped women and held them as sexual slaves before murdering them. Men who got in the way or children the women had with them were murdered outright. Lake committed suicide in 1985 shortly after being arrested on suspicion of shoplifting. After fleeing to Canada and finally being extradited from there, in 1999 Ng stood trial in Orange County, California, for 12 of those murders and was found guilty of 11 of them. He was sentenced to death and is currently on death row at San Quentin State Prison. Videotape of Ng interacting with two of the women subsequently butchered by the pair was introduced at his trial. In one he's seen releasing Kathleen Allen from her bonds while Lake (off-camera) demands, \"Undress for us. We want to see what we bought.\" In another, Ng is seen using a large knife to cut the bra off Brenda O'Connor, then dispassionately telling her, \"Nothing is yours now. It'll be totally ours.\" Though there is no doubt about the eventual fate of these women, it doesn't take place on camera. All rumors to the contrary, no film exists of Lake or Ng killing anyone. As serial killers, Paul Bernardo and Karla Homolka can be considered less depraved than Lake and Ng only in so far as they didn't murder nearly as many. And that is about the most charitable thing that can be said of them. They too were monsters. In 1991 in southern Ontario (Canada), this husband-and-wife team kidnapped, kept as a sex slave, then two weeks later murdered 14-year-old Leslie Mahaffy. In 1992, they abducted 15-year-old Kristen French, kept her for the same purpose for one week, then likewise ended her life. Videotape of French being raped at knifepoint and Mahaffy being assaulted while blindfolded and with her hands cuffed behind her back were shown to the jury during Bernardo's trial. Bernardo is also seen urinating on French and attempting to defecate on her. However, as with Lake and Ng, there's no film of either murder. Predating the deaths of French and Mahaffy, the pair had taken the life of another young victim, Homolka's 15-year-old sister, Tammy Lyn. On Christmas Eve 1990 and as her Christmas present to her then-boyfriend, Homolka drugged the girl with animal tranquilizers, making it possible for Bernardo to rape her at leisure. The child never regained consciousness. She choked on her own vomit and died that night. Videotape of the rape exists. The audio portions of it were played for the jury during Bernardo's trial. The video portion was omitted — the judge deemed it too terrible to be viewed in the courtroom. In 1993, for her part in all three murders, Homolka was sentenced to 12 years behind bars — she completed her sentence and was released from prison in 2005. Bernardo was sentenced to life in prison in 1995. In 1979 Lawrence Bittaker and Roy Norris bought, then made over a 1977 silver GMC cargo van to facilitate the kidnapping of young girls in southern California. The two men had met in prison and there discovered a common interest — raping and killing teenage girls. The following is a list of their victims and dates of death: All were picked up while hitchhiking. The van (\"Murder Mac,\" as christened by Bittaker) was used to transport the first four girls to a remote area of the San Gabriel mountains where the rapes and murders took place. Their final victim, Shirley Ledford, was raped, sodomized, tortured, and killed in the van during a two-hour drive through the San Fernando Valley. It is the audio recording made during that ride that is the closest thing in existence to a snuff film — though the tape is only 18 minutes long and ends well before the girl is killed, it's definitely from that brief and fatal encounter. In return for his cooperation and testimony against Bittaker, the prosecution agreed not to seek the death penalty or life imprisonment without parole for Norris. He was sentenced to 45 years to life. After being denied parole twice, Norris died in prison in 2020. Bittaker was tried by jury, and on 17 February 1981 convicted on 26 charges of rape, torture, kidnapping, and murder. He was sentenced to death but died of natural causes in a California prison in 2019. In 1996 Bittaker sued the state, claiming he'd been subjected to cruel and unusual punishment because he'd been served broken cookies and soggy sandwiches while in the care of its penal system. When it comes to snuff films, it's easy to be romanced by what appears in the news into believing verifiable examples of the genre are out there. Time and again, however, what was ballyhooed as the seizure of a cache of snuff films turns out to be the netting of fakes like the Flower of Flesh and Blood tape or compilation films of the Faces of Death ilk. These aren't snuff films... but you rarely see members of the press taking pains to make this point clear, thus leaving the general public with the idea that tapes of such murders abound. Likewise, anyone who claims to have participated in the making or distribution of a snuff film gets his day in the papers. That the videos fail to turn up might net a tiny followup on a far distant date, but even then not on anything approaching the scale on which the original \"Suspect Claims He Was Part of a Snuff Film Ring!\" articles were emblazoned across the front page. The world being full of depraved individuals is used as justification for believing in the snuff film fallacy. That it could happen is translated in the minds of many to it must have happened. Somewhere. At some time. We just haven't found the film yet. The rumor about snuff films has been with us since the early 1970s. In close to 50 years, not one of those films has surfaced. When tempted to believe this rumor, keep that fact close to your heart. Remind yourself — again and again, if you have to — that nothing ever comes of these investigations. It's possible the unthinkable did come close to happening at one time. In 1989, two Virginia men were arrested by the FBI after broadcasting on a computer bulletin board their plans to kidnap a randomly-selected boy, molest, then kill him for a pornographic snuff film. Daniel Depew and Dean Lambey were picked up, tried, and thrown in jail for hatching this plot, with Depew sentenced to 33 years behind bars, and Lambey to 30. Would they have carried out the scheme? It's hard to say now — their defense maintained all their chatter was nothing but a sick fantasy the men aired, not something they would have acted on. The judge (needless to say in light of those sentences) thought different. The only snuff films proven to exist involve animals. In 1998, nine \"squish\" videos were seized by Scottish police and their distributor arrested. These videos showed scantily-clad women crushing under their high heels an assortment of small animals, including frogs, mice, insects, and a snail. Authorities say the same items have been available in Britain since 1996. Driving to the heart of the matter and pushing aside for the moment all the fakes and movies about movies, it's the activities of serial killers which come closest to mimicking the snuff film bogeyman. In some instances, videotape does exist of murderers torturing victims they would later kill off-camera. Some day it's possible all of a murder will turn up on such a tape. Even so, purists will tend to dismiss this footage because it does not conform to an overly-strict definition involving the necessity for a profit motive. If these snippets of film are to be dismissed, it should be for an entirely different reason. Fear of a thriving snuff film industry is what drives this popular myth. As a society, we're not all that concerned with the concept of serial killers walking among us, killing here and there, because no one thinks of himself or his loved ones as potential serial murder victims. In our naivete, we still equate being selected as a sicko's prey with the victim either having done something to bring it on or not being bright enough to tell something was wrong with the guy. (We hang onto the comforting yet nutty idea we'd be able to recognize such a monster a mile away.) Being beyond reproach ourselves (we'd never do anything to rile such a maniac) and quite brilliant about recognizing serial killers, we don't live in fear of the sex-crazed or hears-voices-in-his-head crazy — clearly, he won't come after us. However, we do fear the notion of a \"murder as a business\" set-up because that takes the slavering maniac right out of the picture and in his place substitutes the Reasonable Man Out To Make a Buck. Victims of such a scheme could be undeserving (innocent) — this could happen to us! And it is on the back of this fear belief in the myth rides in on. We fear not the killers among us, but the businessmen." 1999 "Feb" 2 1960

"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/annabelle-doll-escape-museum/" "false" "Inanimate objects are not known for their mobility." "Dan Evon" 2020-08-14 "The Annabelle doll escaped from the Warren's Occult Museum in Connecticut." "On Aug. 14, 2020, a rumor started to circulate on social media that the so-called Annabelle doll, the supposedly supernatural toy that inspired horror films such as \"The Conjuring,\" had escaped from an occult museum in Connecticut:  The terms \"Annabelle\" and \"Warren Museum\" both started to trend on Twitter as social media users posted messages about the demonic doll that purportedly was on the loose. These fears, however, were for naught, as the Annabelle doll did not actually escape from the Warren Museum — it is, after all, an inanimate object. For those unfamiliar, the Warren's Occult Museum was a real place and housed some of the artifacts collected by paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren. The duo are perhaps most famous for investigating a haunted house in New York in 1975. That investigation inspired the book \"The Amityville Horror\" and several films of the same name. The pair also investigated reports about a Raggedy Ann Doll that was supposedly possessed by a young girl named Annabelle Higgins. This doll, which was later put on display at the museum, also inspired a number of horror movies. Here's an image from the New England Society for Psychic Research Facebook page that supposedly shows the real Annabelle doll:  But the Warren's Occult Museum is no longer in operation. Both Ed and Lorraine Warren have passed away, and according to Atlas Obscura, the museum was closed in 2018. The Monroe Sun reported that the Warrens' son-in-law, Tony Spera, was looking for a new home for the museum (it was reportedly closed due to zoning issues), but the paranormal property has yet to reopen. The status of the museum is a bit of a moot point, however, as this rumor did not start with any sort of police reports, ghoulish videos, spiritual sightings, or a frantic call from Spera to be on the look out for a demonic doll. In fact, Spera posted a YouTube video in which he disputed the \"Annabelle escaped\" rumors.  Spera said: \"I’m here to tell you something, I don’t know if you want to hear this or not, but Annabelle did not escape. Annabelle’s alive — well, I shouldn’t say alive — Annabelle’s here, in all her infamous glory. She never left the museum.” This rumor appears to have originated with a mistranslation. The rumor started circulating shortly after the Hollywood Reporter published an interview with Annabelle Wallis, the actress who played Mia in the \"Annabelle\" movie. Wallis talked about her new film, \"The Silencing,\" as well as what it was like to work with Tom Cruise in \"The Mummy.\" Wallis also talked about \"running\" in her interview, and the Hollywood Reporter included a video of some of the \"escape\" scenes from \"The Mummy.\" As this news circulated on Chinese-language social media sites, the news about Wallis running appears to have been misconstrued as Annabelle (the doll) escaping." 2020 "Aug" 8 1970

"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/florida-high-school-shooter-dreamer/" "false" "In the immediate aftermath of a mass shooting on Valentine's Day, social media users began speculating the suspect was undocumented." "Bethania Palma" 2018-02-14 "The accused school shooter in Florida is a Dreamer, a DACA recipient, or undocumented." "On 14 February 2018, 17 people were killed in a mass shooting at a high school in Parkland, Florida, an affluent community north of Miami. Authorities named Nikolas Cruz — a 19-year-old former student of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School — as the suspect in custody for the crime. Almost immediately after his name was made public, social media users, apparently inspired by nothing more than a Spanish-sounding surname, began spreading an unfounded claim that he is an undocumented DACA recipient. The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program gives people who were brought into the United States as young children temporary authorization to remain legally and DACA recipients are often referred to as Dreamers after proposed legislation.  However Cruz was adopted as a small child, along with his younger brother, by a couple with that surname and is not undocumented. Here are examples of such unverified claims that spread on social media in the hours after the tragedy: Source: Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooter, now in police custody after Parkland, Florida shooting, who has been identified as 19-year-old Nicolas Cruz - is a \"Dreamer\". — Craig R.

At the time of the shooting, lawmakers had been debating about immigration as a whole and the DACA program in particular, going so far as to shut down the government over the issue. Cruz's immigration status, of course, is a distraction that has no relation to the tragedy. In the 24-hour period since the shooting, potentially pertinent details of his life began surfacing including disturbing social media posts showing him posing with weapons and depicting acts of animal cruelty. He had been expelled from Douglas High School the preceding year for disciplinary issues. Douglas High students said they had believed, due to his troubling behavior, that if anyone was going to open fire at the school it would be Cruz. He had legally purchased an AR-15 firearm about a year ago. The unfounded claim that Cruz is a DACA recipient was hardly the only piece of false information circulating on social media in the immediate aftermath of the incident. A now-restricted Twitter account falsely purporting to belong to former Fox News host Bill O'Reilly spread a false image of a person who is not the suspect (the image's presence on message boards like 4chan predates the shooting):" 2018 "Feb" 2 2010

"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/mass-grave-kkk-estate/" "false" "A horrifying tale of racially-motivated violence originated with a fake news site." "Brooke Binkowski" 2017-07-01 "The bodies of dozens of black men were found on the estate of a former Ku Klux Klan member." "On 30 June 2017, a shocking story raced around social media: the twisted, tortured bodies of dozens of black men had been found on what had once been the estate of a prominent Ku Klux Klan leader in Jackson, Mississippi: A Mass grave of torture victims has been uncovered in Jackson, Mississippi, FBI spokesman Adrian Cartwright said Thursday. A Mass burial site of many dozens of black men, who had been subjected to brutal torture and [then] murdered, has been found,” Cartwright said. “In many cases, body parts are missing; most victims had been shot in the head. Authorities state it's still very early in the recovery and identification process, but they estimate the grave to be at least 50 years old and contain upwards of 10 bodies. The FBI did not comment on who they believe is responsible or how the bodies got there due to the ongoing investigation. However, Mississippi records list Eldon Lee Edwards a U.S. Ku Klux Klan leader as owning the property from 1945-1953. Right off the bat, those who read the story might notice several discrepancies. For example, the purported homeowner discovered \"some leg bones,\" which begs the question of how investigators could know, especially very early into what would clearly be a long and involved identification process, the ethnicity or the ancestry of the victims by their bones alone. (It is possible to for forensic anthropologists to gather clues about the ancestry of long-dead people and build \"biological profiles\" (a summary of a dead individual's sex, age at time of death, stature, and health) from bones alone, but teasing out information from human remains takes time and care, and investigators are highly unlikely be so definitive so early in a recovery process.) The article's text also does not match the headline. Were \"dozens\" of bodies discovered, or \"upwards of 10\"? We could call Adrian Cartwright, the Federal Bureau of Investigation spokesman named in this piece, to confirm the numbers, but alas, no Adrian Cartwright exists at the Jackson, Mississippi, FBI office. Nor does anyone by that name work as a national spokesman for the agency. Further, the image used in the head of the article has nothing to do with Jackson, Mississippi. It was stolen from a May 2016 VICE News piece (by Nathanial Janowitz, who also took the photograph) about the efforts to exhume and identify victims of narcoterrorism in Morelos, Mexico, who had been dumped into a mass grave by the government years before: An earlier version of the false story also contained an <a href=\"https://jacksontelegraph.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/a80949d0c27653aef6d766d54f3fd56e.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">image</a> of the purported Jackson, Mississippi home: Moreover, the image of skeletons embedded in the body of the article was taken from a 6 August 2012 feature in Current Archaeology and shows a partially unearthed medieval-era mass grave from a dig site in Spitalfields, London, England — a long way from Jackson, Mississippi:  Eldon Lee Edwards was a real person, an automobile paint sprayer who helped rebuild the U.S. Ku Klux Klan in the 1950s and was known as its Imperial Wizard until his death of a heart attack in 1960. But Edwards was from Atlanta, Georgia, not Jackson, Mississippi, and we were unable to find any evidence that he owned an estate in either state. The Jackson Telegraph is not the online arm of a real newspaper, but merely a fake news site. One of the telltale signs of a fake news site is that the Jackson Telegraph's \"contact\" page provides no physical address, no telephone numbers, no listing of editorial or business staff (or other personnel) — it consists only of a generic e-mail form. While this story is false, racially-based serial murders are not unbelievable and not without precedent, which makes it all the more inflammatory. For example, white serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer (on whom this particular story may have been based) was known to search out black men in particular, which is thought to be one of the reasons that the murders he committed were not initially taken seriously, as the Christian Science Monitor reported in 1991: But many residents, particularly in the gay and minority communities, say the Dahmer case is focusing attention on long-standing local problems that demand attention. Most of Dahmer's victims were black, and he often picked up victims in gay bars. The biweekly gay newspaper, Wisconsin Light, printed a special edition to address the anger and fear among local gays. The case is exposing issues such as minority distrust of the police department and general dissatisfaction within the black community. \"The Dahmer case has put all this on the front page,\" says Donald Leake, president of the Ozaukee County National Association for the Advancement of Colored People." 2017 "Jul" 7 1940

"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/hiv-needles-gas-pump-handles/" "false" "Rumors that service station customers are getting stuck by HIV-loaded syringes affixed to gas pump handles are a hoax." "Barbara Mikkelson" 2001-07-04 "Service station customers are getting stuck by HIV-loaded syringes affixed to gas pump handles." "A hoax urging service station customers to exercise caution when pumping gas appeared first on the Internet in early June 2000: [Collected via e-mail, 2000] My name is Captain Abraham Sands of the Jacksonville, Florida Police Department. I have been asked by state and local authorities to write this email in order to get the word out to car drivers of a very dangerous prank that is occurring in numerous states. Some person or persons have been affixing hypodermic needles to the underside of gas pump handles. These needles appear to be infected with HIV positive blood. In the Jacksonville area alone there have been 17 cases of people being stuck by these needles over the past five months. We have verified reports of at least 12 others in various states around the country. It is believed that these may be copycat incidents due to someone reading about the crimes or seeing them reported on the television. At this point no one has been arrested and catching the perpetrator(s) has become our top priority. Shockingly, of the 17 people who where stuck, eight have tested HIV positive and because of the nature of the disease, the others could test positive in a couple years. Evidently the consumers go to fill their car with gas, and when picking up the pump handle get stuck with the infected needle. IT IS IMPERATIVE TO CAREFULLY CHECK THE HANDLE of the gas pump each time you use one. LOOK AT EVERY SURFACE YOUR HAND MAY TOUCH, INCLUDING UNDER THE HANDLE. If you do find a needle affixed to one, immediately contact your local police department so they can collect the evidence. PLEASE HELP US BY MAINTAINING A VIGILANCE AND BY FORWARDING THIS EMAIL TO ANYONE YOU KNOW WHO DRIVES. THE MORE PEOPLE WHO KNOW OF THIS THE BETTER PROTECTED WE CAN ALL BE.

In Florida and other places on the East Coast a group of people are putting HIV/AIDS infected and filled needles underneath gas pump handles, so when someone reaches to pick it up and put gas in their car, they get stabbed with it. 16 people have been a victim of this crime so far and 10 tested HIV positive. Instead of posting that stupid crap about how your love life will suck for years to come of you don't re-post, post this. It's important to inform people, even if you don't drive, a family member might, and what if they were next? CHECK UNDER THE HANDLE BEFORE YOU GRAB IT!!! IT MIGHT SAVE YOUR LIFE! Tell as many people as you can about this serious issue!

CHECK UNDER THE HANDLE) In common with other AIDS-infected needle scares (e.g., syringe attacks in movies houses and dance clubs and contaminated needles in payphone coin returns), this rumor plays upon our fear of contracting a dread disease through the pursuit of ordinary and harmless activities. There is no Abraham Sands with the Jacksonville Police Department: someone just invented a name to make this \"warning\" look authoritative. No newspaper stories from that city made any mention of Sands, which is unusual (to say the least) about a department's spokesperson; Jacksonville is served by a sheriff's office, not a police department; a phone call to the Jacksonville Sheriff produced the response that they'd never heard of Abraham Sands; and he wasn't listed with the rest of the personnel on the City of Jacksonville Sheriff's Office web site. No news stories out of Florida confirmed the e-mail's claim that 17 people had been injured by these attacks, the City of Jacksonsville Sheriff's Office said the whole thing was a hoax, and the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta stated they were not aware of any cases where HIV had been transmitted by a needle-stick injury outside of a health care setting: Besieged with phone calls and electronic mail, officials in Jacksonville are trying to quell an e-mail hoax that claims hypodermic needles concealed in gas pumps are responsible for spreading the virus that causes AIDS.The Sheriff's Office has received more than 1,000 phone calls and e-mails from people around the country trying to confirm the information. The e-mail, titled \"A dangerous prank going around,\" is purported to be from a \"Capt. Abraham Sands\" with the \"Jacksonville Police Department.\" The Sheriff's Office has never had a Capt. Abraham Sands and has no idea where the message originated. Also, there have been no reports of needles hidden in gas pumps, said John Turner, spokesman for the Sheriff's Office. And the Jacksonville Police Department ceased to exist in 1968 when it was merged with the Sheriff's Office as part of consolidation. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have no reported cases of AIDS from needle-stick injury to anyone outside the health care field. People are also calling the Jacksonville Police and Fire Pension Fund, whose small staff answered about 200 phone calls on Tuesday alone. Because police is part of the fund's name, people from as far away as California are calling, assuming it is part of the police department in Jacksonville. The Sheriff's Office intelligence unit also has looked into the Internet message to see if anything could be done to stop the rumor. The message is a nuisance but not illegal, Turner said. \"We live in a world now where crazy things happen and people want some assurance,\" said spokesman Harry Reagan. Although there have been a few isolated reports of copycat pranksters leaving needles in public places (including gas pumps, such as an incident in May 2017) in the wake of this hoax, none of those incidents has involved a needle bearing any traces of HIV. No matter how it is reworded, the \"Captain Abraham Sands\" message is naught but anotherhoax dreamed up by someone intent upon enjoying the sight of people thrown into a panic over nothing. <!--

"Barbara Mikkelson" 2000-07-25 "Women used to maintain slender figures by ingesting diet pills made from tapeworms." "In August 2014, an episode of Discovery Fit & Health's medical scare docudrama Untold Stories of the E.R. dramatized a supposed real-life scenario in which a teenage girl arrived at Florida hospital's emergency room with a bulging stomach, and the cause of the patient's malady was eventually revealed when she went to the bathroom and excreted tapeworms. The girl's mother then allegedly admitted that she had fed her daughter tapeworm egg pills to help the girl drop some weight before an upcoming beauty pageant:  At some point, the patient went to the bathroom and started screaming. \"It was a toilet bowl full of tapeworms. Blegh!\" [E.R. nurse, Maricar] Cabral-Osorio said. \"It was so gross and she had pooped all these tapeworms. There were a couple that were very long and wiggling around trying to get out of the toilet bowl.\" Trying to keep up the proper bedside manner, Cabral-Osorio told the patient that since the tapeworms were out of the body, she'd be just fine. One question remained. \"We were wondering how did she get those tapeworms, and then you saw the mom turn white,\" Cabral-Osorio said. \"The mom was apologizing to the girl. It's like 'I'm so sorry. You know, I did it just to make you a little skinnier. You needed some help before we went on to the pageant.\" Cabral-Osorio said the mother denied giving her daughter tapeworms per se, but admitted giving the girl pills with tapeworm eggs. This dramatization echoed a century-old rumor about women buying and ingesting diet pills made of tapeworm eggs in order to maintain slender figures, with the parasites taking up residence in the women's intestines and consuming a significant portion of their caloric intake, thereby preventing food from being stored as undesirable, poundage-adding fat and fostering the burning up of previously stored fat. Whether such a method of weight loss was actually ever a common or widespread practice remains a subject of debate. Purported vintage advertisements for tapeworm-based diet pill products dating from the early 20th century are often cited as proof that it was, but whether such products actually matched their advertised descriptions would be difficult to verify at this remove. Just because an ad for a diet pill proclaimed the product contained tapeworm eggs doesn't mean it really did — duping people into buying medicinal nostrums by way of making false and exaggerated claims was standard procedure in the days before government regulation of food and drug products. In the 1960s, memories of those ads resurfaced as appetite-suppressant candies came into vogue, prompting curious dieters to speculate on how they worked. By 1970, diet pills were all the rage, and amphetamines accounted for 8% of all prescriptions written that year. Simple reports about various wonder products evolved into appalling whispered-behind-hands tales about women so desperate to keep their figures that they routinely swallowed magic diet pills which were really tapeworms in capsules. Sometimes the tidbits ended there as \"Did you know ...?\" shared tales, but other times the buzz was expanded into tragic tales detailing the gruesome deaths that had befallen some beautiful but vain young things who were foolish enough to try such remedies. This rumor has been associated with a number of prominent women, such as German model Claudia Schiffer, but probably no one was singled out by it more often than opera singer Maria Callas (1923-1977). Callas was indeed afflicted with tapeworms, but not due to any \"lose weight quick!\" reducing scheme: she was overly fond of steak and liver tartare, raw meat dishes prone to contamination. In her case, the rumor about tapeworm diet pills collided with her real-life condition, resulting in her being misidentified as someone who used such a product. Compounding the error, respected newspapers passed along fatuous statements about her and this rumor as if they were revealed fact. (Example: \"Maria Callas, whose desperation to lose weight led her to swallow a tapeworm, shed several stones over a matter of months and never regained her former power,\" trumpeted The Guardian in 1992.) Some poorly-researched biographies have even claimed this as truth, falling for the myth instead of the reality. It's interesting to note many accounts of the Callas rumor spitefully and self-righteously conclude with the news that her indulgence in this ill-advised tapeworm diet fad caused her to lose the ability to hit the high notes. Such flourishes remind us that vanity rumors are often employed to humble women who aren't much liked or are seen as having attained high positions they did not merit. In Callas' case, her well-publicized, long-standing liaison with Aristotle Onassis caused some to belittle her talent by ascribing her success to her having a powerful benefactor; others wanted to find additional justification for disliking a woman who openly consorted with a (then) married man. The tapeworm diet pill claims usually posited that partakers eventually swallowed deworming pills once they had achieved their desired figures to be rid of the tapeworms, but the rumor also melded with a folk tale to form a new entity:  Other versions of how to draw out a tapeworm include placing milk, cookies, and a hammer near the afflicted person's anus for a few nights and letting the tapeworm gorge himself into complacency on the treats. Once this has been accomplished, the cookie is withheld. When the worm comes all the way out to demand, \"Where's my cookie?,\" whoever is stuck with worm-watching duty that night bashes it with the hammer. An alternative vermifuge calls for 29 steaks and a hammer: The patient eats a steak for 29 days in row, then fasts on the 30th day. The worm becomes closely acquainted with the hammer when it emerges to demand its T-bone." 2000 "Jul" 7 1920

"Barbara Mikkelson" 2005-07-09 "A motorcyclist on bike that has lost its brakes gives his helmet to his girlfriend, saving her life at the cost of his own." "This tear-jerking tale of teen love and traffic tragedy began appearing in our inbox in February 2005. Often titled \"What is Love?\" or \"The Meaning of True Love,\" it remains unattributed at this point, its author unknown to us. A girl and guy were speeding over 100 mph on the road on a motorcycle... Girl: Slow down. Im scared.
Guy: No this is fun.
Girl: No its not. Please, its too scary!
Guy: Then tell me you love me.
Girl: Fine, I love you. Slow down!
Guy: Now give me a BIG hug.
-:- Girl hugs him -:-
Guy: Can you take my helmet off & put it on yourself? Its bugging me. (In the paper the next day): A motorcycle had crashed into a building because of brake failure. Two people were on it, but only one survived. The truth was that halfway down the road, the guy realized that his brakes broke, but he didn't want to let the girl know. Instead, he had her say she loved him & felt her hug one last time, then had her wear his helmet so that she would live even though it meant that he would die. The story appears to be a work of fiction in that we've been unable to find any news stories of such an accident. (Mind you, the lack of details such as the names of the people involved, the approximate date of the accident and so much as a rough idea of which city or even country it happened in make searching for information akin to looking for a needle in a haystack.) Numerous folks who know far more about motorcycles than we do have pointed out that most (if not all) bikes have two braking systems which are independent of one another, so it would hardly be likely for both to fail at the same time. Even if they did, a motorbike that has lost its brakes can be brought to a stop through downshifting (gearing down) or even through turning off the engine (although the fact that a brake-less bike traveling at high speeds can be safely halted doesn't necessarily rule out this account, because panic could cause the driver to think he had no other option but to crash into something). As the narrative has passed from one person to another, it has picked up a coda that has since become part of what now gets forwarded: Love is not selfish so
Love is not being happy
it is to make happy to whom you love
even if you are unhappy with it.\"So take five minutes out of your time to tell someone you love them because you really never know if this is the last day of your life.... Hope everyone realizes and feels what true love is... Another coda, one less often seen, reads thusly: These end notes explain the moral of the tale, that it is important to frequently reassure the folks who are important in your life that you love them. While you won't catch us preaching against the value of constantly repeated expressions of affection in successful relationships, the premise of the story about the helmet-less swain is flawed — failure to utter \"I love you\" does not mean you risk your nearest and dearest's not knowing such information if you were to suddenly expire." 2005 "Jul" 7 2000

"David Mikkelson" 2000-12-13 "Stoned babysitter cooks an infant in the oven." "A couple leaves their infant in the charge of a teenage, hippie-type girl while they go out on the town for the evening. When the mother phones home a few hours later to check up on things, the babysitter informs her that everything is fine and that she has put the turkey in the oven. A few moments later the couple recalls that they left no turkey at home; they rush home and find that the babysitter, high on LSD, has cooked their baby in the oven. Collected by Fowke, 1973] This story was told to me by a friend who heard it on the news on the radio about a year or so ago. It is a factual account. There was a girl and she was baby-sitting. The parents had gone out to a very big party and had left this infant at home with this sixteen-year-old girl. So she was babysitting and they phoned just to see if everything was all right. She said, \"Oh, fine. Everything's great. The turkey's in the oven. The mother went, \"Oh, okay, fine,\" and she hung up. Then she looked at her husband and went, \"The turkey's in the oven? We didn't have a turkey!\" He said, \"What's the matter?\" So they decided they had better go home and see what was the matter. Maybe there was something wrong with the babysitter. They excused themselves from the party and went home. So they walked in the house and saw the baby-sitter sitting in the chair freaking out. She had put the little infant in the oven and had thought it was a turkey. Variations: The urban legend probably circulated as a cautionary tale about the dangers of leaving children in the care of strangers before incorporating an additional warning against drug use in the 1960s. Brunvand, for example, cites a version collected by folklorist Lydia Fish in which drugs play no part: After the parents left, the baby starting crying. No matter what the sitter did, the baby would not stop. After a time, the baby's crying drove the sitter mad, and she put the kid in the oven and turned it up as high as it would go. This tale was widely cited in the 1960s and 1970s as a \"true story\" illustrating the dangers of illicit drug use. As with the legend of Blue Star Acid, it contrasts evil drug users and innocent children, with the latter suffering harm due to the depredations of the former. Other \"cooked to death\" legends include: Update: On Sept. 23, 1999, aspects of this chilling legend played out in real life when the body of 1-month-old Joseph Lewis Martinez was discovered in the microwave of his parents' home. His mother, Elizabeth Renee Otte (19) was arrested for his murder, but her representatives claimed she had been in a state of confusion at the time she folded her son in half, loaded him into the microwave, and powered it on. She'd had epileptic seizures before, and they speculated that while in the throes of one she mistook her child for a bottle of milk she was attempting to warm. Some believed the scenario as described by Otte's representatives to be plausible, but others saw the tragedy as yet another teenage mother murdering her baby, then claiming diminished capacity on whatever grounds she could come up with. After psychological and neurological exams undertaken to determine Otte's competency to stand trial were completed, she pled no contest to involuntary manslaughter charges on September 25, 2000 and was sentenced to five years in prison on December 13, 2000. In November 2006, Ohio resident China Arnold was charged with the Aug. 30, 2005 murder of her one-month-old daughter, Paris Talley. The death was ruled a homicide caused by hyperthermia (high body temperature). The child was believed to have been microwaved to death because of the absence of external burns, that lack precluding the deadly rise in temperature having been caused open flame, scalding water, or a heating pad. In August 2008, China Arnold was found guilty of aggravated murder in the death of her child. In November 2010, the conviction was overturned. In May 2011, China Arnold was again convicted of aggravated murder and sentenced to life without the possibility of parole." 2000 "Dec" 12 1970

"Barbara Mikkelson" 2003-09-24 "A troop of Boy Scouts dies after roasting hot dogs on oleander sticks." "This sorrowful tale of the fatal poisoning by oleander sticks used to roast treats over a campfire has been part of the urban legend canon for decades, with many of our readers in the United States reporting having heard versions of it in the 1960s and even the 1950s. It was also told as a true, local, and recent tale in the 1970s in Australia. 1999 A troop of Boy Scouts on a camping trip (no one can say where specifically) decides to have a weenie/marshmallow roast. They cut some sticks for everyone, and roast away, and eat their fill. The next morning they are all dead because they all used oleander sticks to roast with, and as your basic retard knows, oleander is deadly poison (where was the scoutmaster?).  2003 I understand that any part of the oleander plant is toxic to all mammals. However, my veterinarian told me a story about a family cooking hot dogs over a fire while camping. Supposedly, the family unwittingly speared the dogs with branches from an oleander to cook them over the fire. All of the family members succumbed to oleander poisoning, which affects the heart.   In fact, the tale is far older. A version of it appears in a gardening book published in England in 1886, under the entry for \"Nerium\" (which is another name for this plant): The leaves are fatal to animals (horses, &c): the flowers have caused death to those who carelessly picked and ate them, and it is on record that the branches, divested of their bark, and used as skewers, have poisoned the meat roasted on them, and killed seven of twelve people who partook of it. Similar is this cite from an 1853 book (which itself references a 1844 publication): In 1809, when the French troops were lying before Madrid, some of the soldiers went a marauding, every one bringing back such provisions as could be found. One soldier formed the unfortunate idea of cutting the branches of the Oleander for spits and skewers for the meat when roasting. This tree, it may be observed, is very common in Spain, where it attains considerable dimensions. The wood having been stripped of its bark, and brought in contact with the meat, was productive of most direful consequences, for of twelve soldiers who ate of the roast seven died, and the other five were dangerously ill. We've no idea how valid those claims from 1886 and 1853 are, but at least these entries grant a far better appreciation of the age of this cautionary tale. Oleander is a common outdoor woody shrub found in warmer climates, often used for edging freeways or gardens. It is also quite poisonous, with the ingestion of as little as a single leaf reportedly being enough to kill a child. It is a plant worthy of respect even by those who neither have children nor themselves make it their habit to gnaw on shrubbery, as cats and dogs -- and even horses -- have been killed by oleander poisoning. According to this well-traveled cautionary tale, the unwitting use of oleander branches or leaves in a campfire brings about the death of a group of people either through roasting sticks fashioned from the plant adding a fatal kick to cookout ingestibles or the leaves or branches used to feed the flames creating a deadly cloud of poisonous smoke. Because this is a legend meant to make a point about the danger posed by this particular plant so that those exposed to the tale will afterwards be more careful about their use of plants in the wild, the victims are presented as folks with whom listeners will sympathize: a troop of Boy Scouts or a vacationing family (which implies the presence, and thus the demise, of small children). The use of sympathetic characters makes for a loss deemed especially tragic and adds to the pathos of the story, which in turn helps ensure that the tale better sticks in memory and so makes for a more effective teaching device. Likewise, in this legend the element of horror is raised to the highest possible level in that everyone in the group exposed to the oleander dies: not one Boy Scout survives the hot dogging, nor does any member of the luckless family live through their exposure to the acrid smoke. All die, as they must if the point is to be made. Was there ever such an ill-fated family or troop of Boy Scouts? Though we've searched for news stories about such a tragedy, we haven't found any, not even an account of a non-fatal poisoning. Death by oleander is rare to begin with, and the cases we've located so far involved direct ingestion of the plant. In Los Angeles in 2001, a woman suspected of administering a lethal mixture of antifreeze and oleander to her husband was charged with murder. Also in Los Angeles, but in 2000, two adopted Russian boys (age 3 and 2) died from eating oleander leaves off a neighbor's hedge. Both were found dead in their cribs. Their mother said she saw the children chewing the leaves a few days before they died and noticed they had picked some again the night of their deaths. How poisonous is poisonous? Oleander (leaves and branches) is deemed extremely dangerous, with the poison known to affect the heart, produce severe digestive upset, and to have caused death. The size and relative health of the person ingesting the plant have a great deal to do with the severity of the poisoning. Their relatively small body size places children especially at risk, making oleander a plant one may not want in one's garden if children are part of the household or live nearby. Yet could enough of the plant's deadly essence be transmitted to a foodstuff during a cooking process that involves skewering the item to be eaten on an oleander stick? Highly unlikely says this 2005 toxicological study: Methods: Hot dogs (Hebrew National Beef Franks, ConAgra Foods) were skewered their full length on either freshly-cut or dried Nerium oleander branches (4 each) and cooked over a disposable charcoal barbecue. The cooked hot dogs were then frozen until analysis of oleandrin content by liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy. Result: Hot dogs cooked on dried branches contained 14.3±8.8 ppb oleandrin, while hot dogs cooked on freshly-cut branches contained 7.0±2.1 ppb oleandrin (control: 1 ppb< oleandrin). The most contaminated hot dog contained 1.5 mg oleandrin; even allowing for other unmeasured cardiac glycosides, this oleandrin content is orders of magnitude lower than that expected to cause human toxicity if the hot dogs were consumed. In addition, several mechanical difficulties with both the freshly-cut and dried oleander branches make their practical use as skewers to cook food unlikely.

"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/a-brew-to-a-kill/" "true" "The flood reportedly took place in London in 1814." "Barbara Mikkelson" 2002-08-31 "Nine people died in a beer flood in 1814." "The ongoing spate of Internet reports of unusual deaths, both real and fictional, might lead some to believe extraordinary modes of demise are a recent phenomenon. Nothing could be further from the truth — the Grim Reaper has always found incredible methods of ending human life. One such instance took place in 1814 in London. On October 17 of that year, a rupture in a brewery tank containing 3,500 barrels of beer caused a flood of fatal proportions in the London parish of St. Giles. The wave of beer swept victims off their feet, dashed them against walls, and buried them under debris. Two houses were demolished in the sea of beer suddenly loosed upon town, and nine people lost their lives in the flood of suds. America endured a comparable disaster in January 1919 when a rupture in a molasses tank unleashed a flood of goo that killed twenty-one Bostonians." 2002 "Aug" 8 1810

"It was a \"Halloween\" prank that went viral. Galveston, Texas-based, attorney Mark Metzger dressed up as the fictional killer Michael Myers from the \"Halloween\" horror series and wandered the beaches of the coastal city as a storm loomed. Houston TV news station KTRK reporter Mycah Hatfield spotted Metzger wandering the beach and posted a video to Twitter:  Hatfield reported that Metzger's prank was short-lived. He was arrested by police, who stated that someone called to report a masked man carrying a bloody knife. Metzger was cited for disorderly conduct and released once officers determined the knife was fake, per Hatfield's reporting. Metzger posted about his adventure on social media, noting that his stunt had upset some. \"My methods might not work for everyone, but I guarantee I'll please more than I’ll piss off,\" he wrote.

"Madison Dapcevich" 2021-01-22 "A 23-year-old Ohio woman died after her head became trapped between her vehicle door and its frame after colliding with the payment machine in a parking garage." "A 23-year-old woman from Columbus, Ohio, was killed in January 2021 after her head became stuck between her vehicle door and its frame after colliding with a parking garage payment kiosk. According to the Columbus Division of Police (CPD), the fatal accident occurred on Jan. 18 just before midnight local time. Victoria Strauss was exiting a parking garage near the Flytown District in downtown Columbus. When she went to pay for her parking, Strauss reportedly dropped her credit card. When she opened her car door and leaned out of the vehicle to pick up the card, she “inadvertently accelerated and collided with the parking kiosk.” “The collision pinned her between her car door and the door frame,” wrote the police department in a post shared to Facebook on Jan. 18. Her head apparently became caught between the door and frame.  An accident investigation unit with the CPD responded and initiated an investigation, which was ongoing at the time of writing. It was determined that Strauss died as a result of the collision and was pronounced dead at the scene, according to a report filed by the department. The Columbus Dispatch reported the Ohio State University graduate and Florida native was found by a security guard. The incident was reportedly captured by security cameras in the garage in which Strauss' car can be seen accelerating. Some media reports differed from police reports as to where exactly her head was trapped, so we've reached out to authorities and will update this post if we get more information." 2021 "Jan" 1 2020

"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/helltown-document-real-events/" "false" "The Travel Channel's \"Helltown\" definitely includes a whole lot of fiction." "Dan Evon" 2019-11-25 "The film \"Helltown\" is a genuine documentary about a teenager's mysterious disappearance, a cult, and a military mission gone wrong." "In November 2019, we started receiving queries about a Travel Channel television \"documentary\" called \"Helltown\" that supposedly showed the strange goings-on in an abandoned town in Ohio. Among other things, this show claimed that this town was the site of a \"cult compound shooting\" that left 14 people dead in the 1960s, that a teenager mysteriously disappeared after entering a restricted area in 2016 and was most likely eaten by a Wendigo (a mythological creature), and that a military operation in the area went haywire after the soldiers stumbled upon a group of occultists. We'll point out some specific inaccuracies throughout this article, but by and large \"Helltown\" is a work of fiction. This is a scripted piece of entertainment and not a genuine documentary. The experts, townspeople, police officers, and even the soldiers in the \"archival\" or \"found footage\" are actors.  \"Helltown\" first aired on the Travel Channel just before Halloween in 2017, but it still frequently gets re-aired. Here's a trailer for the movie. It starts with a brief disclaimer noting that \"this story is inspired by accounts of a real American town that has been abandoned for more than 40 years.\" It isn't until the final frames of the film, however, that the Travel Channel reveals that \"certain events in this film are fictional\": None of the institutions or agencies that appear in the film are affiliated or associated with it in any way, nor have approved its contents. Any similarities in the film to actual persons, living or dead, is entirely coincidental. Though certain events in this film are fictional, the town of Boston, Ohio was real, and was forcibly evacuated by the United States Government in 1975. Travel Channel's disclaimer goes on to say that the \"reports of Paranormal and Occult Activity in the town are real, and have been cited as a possible reasons for the 1975 evacuation,\" and that \"conspiracy theorists continue to debate why the U.S. Government evacuated Boston, Ohio.\" While this Travel Channel special states that it is based on real \"reports\" and rumors, it also peddles a number of outright falsehoods. For instance, a 16-year-old was not killed by a Wendigo (or a bear) in 2016, authorities did not kill 14 people during a shootout with a cult, and two children did not mysteriously vanish from the area. This article is not meant to be a comprehensive list of every misleading detail included in the \"Helltown\" show. Rather, we're going to point out how some of the \"evidence\" was manufactured in order to show that this \"documentary\" is really just a work of fiction. What's the real story about \"Helltown\"? In 1974, Congress passed Public Law 93-555, which allowed the federal government to acquire land in order to establish the Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area. Boston Township in Ohio was one piece of land that was acquired for this project. Shortly after U.S. President Gerald Ford signed this legislation into law, the government started to purchase properties in Boston and forced people to move out of the newly designated national recreation area. The Frontline special \"For the Good of All\" took a look at how this legislation impacted the local population of Boston: When a national recreation site between Cleveland and Akron was first mandated by Congress in 1974, everyone applauded the project. But Frontline found that park policies of condemning hundreds of businesses and homes soon generated intense local opposition as well as charges that the homes of politically influential citizens were being spared. The government purchased hundreds of homes with the hopes of turning the area into a national park, but the project quickly fell behind schedule. As houses sat abandoned and vacant for years, urban legends about the area started to grow. Some claimed that the area was haunted, and that the government only purchased the land to cover up some sort of nefarious activity. Similar rumors spread, and soon the area became known as \"Helltown.\" According to Atlas Obscura, the last of the abandoned buildings of \"Helltown\" were torn down in 2016.  What does the Travel Channel special \"Helltown\" get wrong? It's true that a number of houses were left abandoned in the 1970s after the government acquired the area of Boston Township in Ohio in 1974 to develop the Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area. While this historical event serves as the starting point for this show, \"Helltown\" quickly veers off into the world of fiction. The \"experts\" in \"Helltown\" are actors. For starters, the main expert in this \"Helltown\" video is presented as a professor of folklore and mythology at Cuyahoga Community College named Paul Wyndham:  But this is not a \"professor of folklore.\" This is an actor. We reached out to Cuyahoga Community College and we were told that there was no \"Paul Wyndham\" on staff. Furthermore, according to a spokesperson for the college, Wyndham doesn't even pronounce \"Cuyahoga\" correctly in the film. This character is being played by actor Dave Evans, who apparently has a penchant for playing \"experts\" in pseudo-science documentaries. In 2012, he played \"Dr. Paul Robertson, former NOAA scientist,\" in Animal Planet's pseudo-documentary \"Mermaids: The Body Found.\"  \"Helltown\" presents a number of other characters as if they were \"locals\" from the area. Again, however, these are just actors. The most misleading use of an actor comes from the \"archival\" footage that was supposedly unearthed during the making of this mockumentary. While conspiracy theorist Terry Greenbaum (played by actor Darren White) presents this footage as if it were taken in 1975 — the footage is preceded by a title card reading \"The following is an edited version of the raw 16mm footage recovered from Jack Writer's Camera Magazine, Filmed in 1975\" — it actually features modern footage of actor Michael Lipka. A 16-year-old was not eaten by a Wendigo (or a bear) in 2016. One outlandish claim in the movie is that a teenager was killed by a \"Wendigo,\" a mythological man-eating creature, in 2016. In addition to claiming that a teenager was killed, \"Helltown\" also claims that authorities covered up the truth about the mythical man-eater by blaming a bear for the teen's death. While this anecdote is presented in the form of a news report, this is just another staged production. This section (which appears around the 10-minute mark) features a fictional police official named Capt. Marie Hutchinson and stock footage of a deceased bear. There is also not a \"WBOH News\" channel in Ohio. We were unable to find any credible reports about a 16-year-old who was killed by a bear (or a Wendigo) in Cuyahoga National Forest in 2016. It appears that this rumor was made up out of whole cloth. Two children did not disappear in \"Helltown.\" At one point in this \"documentary,\" the filmmakers blame the disappearance of two children from Boston Township on a local cult. As evidence, they show what appears at first glance to be a newspaper clipping:  This image, however, doesn't feature two children who went missing in Boston Township. Both of these images were taken from modern stock photographs:  A shootout at a cult compound did not result in 14 deaths. A second fake newspaper clipping is also featured in the \"Helltown\" movie. This time, a doctored newspaper clipping is used to push the false claim that 14 people were killed in a shootout between authorities and the \"WW Cult.\"  This is not a genuine newspaper, and the featured photograph does not show the \"compound headquarters\" of the WW Cult. This image actually shows a rural farm in the Czech Republic. \"Helltown\" is a work of fiction. In sum, the federal government in 1974 started to acquire land in Ohio to develop the Cuyahoga National Recreation Area, an actual place. This forced the residents of Boston Township to move, leaving a number of homes and buildings vacant, which eventually led to rumors about paranormal and occult activity in the area. While some people may truly believe that the area of \"Helltown\" is haunted, the majority of anecdotes included in this Travel Channel special are completely scripted fabrications being re-told by actors. A 16-year-old was not eaten by a Wendigo, two children did not mysteriously disappear, and authorities did not kill 14 people during a shootout. These incidents, as stated in the disclaimer at the close of this Travel Channel special, are completely \"fictional.\" We therefore rate the claim of strange happenings in this town as \"False.\"" 2019 "Nov" 11 1970

"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/woman-undiscovered-dead-home/" "true" "A meme referred to the tragic circumstances surrounding the death and discovery of Joyce Carol Vincent in 2006." "Dan MacGuill" 2018-11-20 "In 2006, the skeletal remains of Joyce Carol Vincent were found in her home, with the television on, years after her death." "In November 2018, the \"Weird Facts\" Facebook page posted a widely-shared meme which outlined the death of Joyce Carol Vincent, summarizing it as \"In 2006, a woman (Joyce Carol Vincent) was found in her London flat, skeletonized, after 3 years of being dead -- with the TV still running\": Notwithstanding the somewhat crass imagery used in the meme, this was unfortunately a largely accurate description of the tragic circumstances surrounding the death of Joyce Carol Vincent, who did indeed remain undiscovered at home for around two years, dying around December 2003. According to material prepared for release to the news media by the Metropolitan Police, as well as reports by the BBC and the Press Association, the following are the known facts surrounding Vincent's demise. Some readers might find the details disturbing. On 26 January 2006, Vincent's remains were discovered at her apartment in Wood Green, north-east London. Workers from the Metropolitan Housing Trust, an organization which provides affordable housing and is now known as Metropolitan Thames Valley, had forced entry while attempting to inquire about thousands of pounds of unpaid rent arrears. Vincent had been placed in the small apartment as part of a scheme for victims of domestic violence. Vincent's remains were badly decomposed, and pathologist Dr. Simon Poole later described them as being \"largely skeletal,\" which supports the claim made in the \"Weird Facts\" meme. According to evidence heard at a coroner's inquest, Vincent was found lying on her back on the floor of her living room next to a shopping bag and Christmas presents which she had wrapped but never delivered. Her television was indeed still switched on when Vincent was found. She was identified by reference to dental records. Based on the expiration dates of food and medication found in Vincent's flat, it was estimated that she had died around December 2003, some two years earlier -- not three years earlier, as the \"Weird Facts\" meme and several news reports mistakenly stated. She was born in London to Grenadian immigrant parents in 1965, and was 38 years old at the time of her death. In the years after Vincent was discovered, the filmmaker Carol Morley tracked down her friends, colleagues and associates. In interviews which would ultimately form the basis of the 2011 documentary film Dreams of a Life, those who knew Vincent universally recalled their shock and disbelief at the circumstances of her death and discovery. In the film some friends recounted actually having read news accounts of her death in April 2006, but without an accompanying photograph, they did not connect the horrific circumstances of her discovery with the person they had known. According to those accounts, Vincent had for many years been a very social, popular professional young woman who worked in London's fast-paced financial district in the 1980s and 1990s, was highly intelligent and charming, and was remarkably attractive and frequently the object of male attention. Vincent, who was at one time an aspiring singer, was acquainted with the soul vocalist Betty Wright, and had dinner with other iconic musical artists, including Gil Scott-Heron, Jimmy Cliff, and Ben E. King. In 1990, Vincent briefly met and conversed with Nelson Mandela backstage at a concert in London's Wembley Stadium. Although she had many friends, Vincent's friendships appear to have been somewhat fleeting, and despite the deep affection in which she was held, she was known for \"drifting\" in and out of social groups and relationships and sometimes appeared troubled. Her acquaintances recalled that she was distant towards her family members. According to Morley's interviews with friends of Vincent, she became engaged to marry an unidentified man in the late 1990s, and the Metropolitan Police later noted that she had been involved in a \"domestic incident\" in 1998. In Morley's documentary, Vincent's friends observed that she was likely to have been in at least one abusive relationship during that time. By 2001, Vincent left her job at the accounting firm Ernst & Young and progressively lost contact with her family members, friends and former colleagues, working for a time as a cleaner. She changed addresses frequently but moved into her final apartment in Wood Green in February 2003, having been placed there as part of a women's refuge program for victims of domestic violence. Her friends have speculated that she may have become isolated and withdrawn over time because she was ashamed of the abuse she had suffered and the shift in her professional and personal circumstances, and she may also have been avoiding detection by an abusive former partner. In November 2003, she was briefly hospitalized after vomiting blood and was diagnosed with a peptic ulcer. Although she is believed to have died around a month later, the coroner was unable to arrive at a cause of death due to the decomposition of her remains by January 2006. She also suffered from asthma, which was cited by her friends as a possible cause of death. Vincent did not take drugs or smoke and did not drink alcohol to excess. From the outset, the Metropolitan Police made it clear that they did not suspect foul play in her demise." 2018 "Nov" 11 1960

"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/essie-dunbar-funeral-discovery/" "unproven" "In 1915, Essie Dunbar was allegedly pronounced dead after suffering from a seizure. Legend has it that she was discovered to be alive mid-way through her burial." "Alex Kasprak" 2018-09-15 "A 30-year-old woman was partially buried during a funeral service in 1915, only to be found alive inside the coffin by her grieving sister." "One of humanity's most historically pervasive fears is either being buried alive or waking up six feet underground to find that you have been mistaken for dead. Though rare, such events have occurred from time to time, and they form the basis of an entire book by Jan Bondeson titled Buried Alive: The Terrifying History of Our Most Primal Fear. This book, published in 2001, is the primary source of online claims about a woman named Essie Dunbar who according to legend was pronounced dead following a seizure, was partially buried during her funeral service, and was then exhumed for the benefit of her grieving sister who had arrived late. When the coffin was opened, the story goes, Dunbar was found to be both alive and awake: In the summer of 1915, Dr. D. K. Briggs of Blackville, South Carolina, was called to attend the thirty-year-old black woman Essie Dunbar, who had suffered an attack of epilepsy. He found no signs of life and declared her dead. The corpse was put in a wooden coffin and the funeral arranged for eleven in the following morning, to give Essie's sister, who lived in a neighboring town, the chance to participate. Although the ceremony was a lengthy one, with three preachers taking turns to perform, the sister had still not arrived when Essie's coffin was lowered into its six-foot-deep grave. She appeared a few minutes later, however, and the ministers agreed to dig up the coffin so that she might see Essie one last time. But when the screws were removed and the coffin lid opened, Essie sat up in her coffin and smiled at her sister. The three ministers fell backward into the grave, the shortest suffering three broken ribs as the other two trampled him in their desperate efforts to get out. The mourners, including Essie's sister, believed that she was a ghost, and fled yelling. When they saw that Essie, who had climbed up from the grave, was actually pursuing them, they stampeded into town in a state of complete hysteria. For many years, Essie Dunbar was viewed with suspicion in the neighborhood; there were rumors that she was a zombie who had returned from the dead. As far as we can identify, no first-hand, contemporaneously published accounts corroborate this tale. Instead, the primary evidence for its occurrence appears to be newspaper reports published decades later. As such, even Bondeson, the author of Buried Alive, qualifies the claim to a certain extent in his book by noting that \"In later life, [Dunbar] became a popular local personality, and it is by no means unlikely that the story of her resurrection from the tomb was somewhat improved upon as it was told and retold, and finally appeared in the newspapers after her second and final death in 1955.\" In point of fact, Essie Dunbar actually died on 22 May 1962. The 1955 newspaper article Bondeson referenced (published in the Augusta Chronicle on 25 August 1955) was actually written on the occurrence of the death of the doctor who had supposedly incorrectly declared Dunbar dead in 1915, and its recounting of Dunbar's alleged mistaken burial was based on a second-hand account of the event told by a local physician who had “treated a minister who was injured as a result of the bizarre incident”: BLACKVILLE, S.C. — Essie Dunbar, 70, has outlived the doctor who pronounced her dead 40 years ago. The Blackville Negro was picking cotton today, very much alive, even though her funeral was preached and her coffin sealed nearly half a century ago, The strange saga of her \"death\", known to most of this south-central Carolina town's older residents, was unfolded today to a Chronicle reporter by Dr. O.D. Hammond, a local physician who treated a minister who was injured as a result of the bizarre incident. This article has been reprinted verbatim in several newspapers at various times in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1980s, and it served as the primary source of an article about Essie Dunbar for the British magazine Fortean Times, which was ultimately cited in Bondeson’s Buried Alive. Although anecdotal evidence for Essie Dunbar’s accidental burial may exist, the details of the event have their origins in a second-hand report by a doctor who told a tale to a reporter 40 years after its alleged occurrence. As such, verifying the literal truthfulness of the tale as now presented over a century later is problematic." 2018 "Sep" 9 1910

"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/police-delaware-shoot-kill-man-wheelchair/" "true" "Jeremy McDole's death in 2015 received renewed attention online in 2018." "Arturo Garcia" 2018-03-20 "Police in Wilmington, Delaware shot and killed a man who was in a wheelchair at the time of the encounter." "In early 2018, the 2015 extrajudicial killing of 28-year-old Jeremy McDole in Wilmington, Delaware received renewed attention after the incident was the subject of a Facebook post. The post, which contains footage of McDole's shooting at the hands of police, has received millions of views since being published in January 2018. The caption reads: Cops murdered a man in a wheelchair in Wilmington, Delaware. Officers were not held accountable for their crimes, but the man's family received a $1,500,000 settlement. However, the post does not mention that McDole was actually shot and killed on 23 September 2015. The incident led to anger toward police and a lawsuit filed by McDole's family which resulted in a $1.5 million settlement being awarded to them in December 2016. According to reports, police encountered McDole after receiving reports about a man in a wheelchair who had allegedly shot himself. Cellphone camera footage of McDole's death shows an officer approaching him with his gun drawn yelling, \"Show me your hands!\" The camera moves down as a gunshot can be heard. Seconds later, more officers approach McDole with their own weapons drawn. McDole's hands can be seen moving from his waist to his legs and he can be seen adjusting himself in the chair, which he used after being shot when he was 18 years old. As McDole's hands move toward the front of his jeans, the officers fire on him. Despite being described as having a gun, no firearm is visible near him. Investigators later said that they recovered a .38-caliber handgun by his side, an allegation that McDole's family questioned. The family sued both the city of Wilmington and the police department in March 2016, saying that McDole was the victim of \"grossly excessive and wanton lethal force\" on the part of police. Two months later, the state state Department of Justice released a report stating that the four officers involved — Senior Cpl. Joseph Dellose, Cpl. Thomas Lynch, Cpl. James MacColl, and Senior Cpl. Danny Silva — would not be charged in connection with McDole's death. In January 2017, the United States Justice Department also said that it would not pursue a federal civil rights lawsuit against the officer, saying there was insufficient evidence to disprove the officers' claims that they shot McDole in self-defense." 2018 "Mar" 3 2010

"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/katie-flynn-car-crash/" "true" "A website that publishes viral content accurately recounts the terrible story of Katie Flynn's death in 2005." "Dan MacGuill" 2018-03-02 "Katie Flynn was decapitated while wearing a seat belt, in a 2005 car crash on Long Island, New York." "In February 2018, the web site Newsner, which produces viral content, recounted the horrifying story of the death of Katie Flynn, a seven-year-old girl who was decapitated in a devastating car crash on Long Island, New York, in 2005. We received several enquiries about the veracity of the article, and a similar one published by Trending Stylist, on 28 February. Unfortunately, it's true. In the early hours of 3 July 2005, a drunk driver traveling at 70 miles per hour the wrong way down a highway crashed into a limousine carrying several members of Katie's family, who were returning home after a wedding. The collision caused the instant deaths of the limousine's driver, 59-year-old Stanley Rabinowitz and seven-year-old Katie Flynn, a niece of the bride. Other passengers suffered serious injuries, including Chris Tangney, the father of the bride, whose leg was broken so badly in the crash that it had to be amputated. As CNN reported in 2008: An off-duty security officer returning home from work was first on the scene. \"I approached the limo driver, and I guess I went into shock,\" says New York State court officer Michael Lerardi. \"It looked like an explosion. The motor, basically, was just sitting on top of him. I knew he was dead.\" The limo driver, 59-year-old Stanley Rabinowitz, was killed instantly. Next to arrive was Lt. Michael Tangney, the bride's uncle, who had attended the wedding just hours before. \"I was walking to the rear of the limousine when a gentleman was coming away from it, and he said, 'Don't go back there. It's bad,'\" Lt. Tangney says. \"I opened the rear door to the limousine and realized it was my family.\" Lt. Tangney's brother -- Jennifer's father, Chris -- was lying on the floor, his legs wrapped around the service bar, broken in numerous places. The rest of the family was piled on top of each other. Jennifer's mother, Denise, was severely injured, as was Jennifer's husband, Neil, who tried to crawl out of the limo to get help despite his broken back. Five-year-old Grace was also trapped inside the wreckage. Jennifer, whose foot was injured, managed to climb out and was searching for Katie, who had been lying on the side seat before the crash. \"We couldn't find Kate,\" Lt. Tangney says. Then, Jennifer made a devastating discovery -- Katie had been decapitated by her seat belt. \"Then all of a sudden Mrs. Flynn came out of the car with her child's head in her hand,\" says Michael Lerardi, one of the 70 paramedics and police officers who were called to the scene. \"I got numb. I thought I was going to collapse,\" says Officer Christopher Pandolfo. \"I looked into the back of the limousine, and I saw Katie's remains. She was wearing this dress, and I just started shaking.\" This fact check includes links to court testimony that some readers might find disturbing. In February 2007, New York Supreme Court Justice Alan Honorof sentenced 25-year-old Martin Heidgen to a minimum of 18 years in prison on two counts of second-degree \"depraved indifference\" murder, and related charges. Heidgen had been drinking for several hours in Manhattan and Nassau County, before he drove his pick-up truck into the limousine. At the trial, there was some dispute over whether Katie Flynn had been wearing a seat belt at the time of the collision. Dr Michael DeMartino, who conducted Flynn's autopsy, testified under cross-examination from the defense that his autopsy report had described her as a \"rear seat unrestrained passenger,\" based on preliminary information provided to DeMartino by some first responders. However, DeMartino agreed with the prosecution that Flynn's injuries were \"consistent with a child who had been lap belted and was lying down on a bench seat and thrown forward during the high-speed crash,\" but also said that the injuries \"might be\" consistent with the girl not wearing a seat belt. Ultimately, DeMartino appeared to lean heavily toward the likelihood that Flynn had been wearing a seat belt at the time of her death, and that the seat belt getting caught around her neck may have led directly to the terrible manner of her death. He noted that had she not been wearing a seat belt, it would have been reasonable to expect much more severe injuries to the rest of her body than were actually observed, namely \"very small bruising\" to her left knee and elbow and some bruising on her left hand. Furthermore, the family of Katie Flynn, who were present in the limousine with her that night, adamantly insisted that she was wearing a seat belt. At the trial, Jennifer Flynn -- Katie's mother, and the sister of the bride -- testified that her husband Neil had placed Katie on a bench seat in the limousine, and \"seat belted her in\" while she was sleeping. Chris Tangney -- a retired Nassau County police officer, father of the bride, and grandfather of Katie Flynn -- similarly testified that the girl had been lying down, asleep, on a bench seat in the limousine, with her seat belt buckled, at the time of the collision. In a devastating and scathing victim impact statement read out to the court, Jennifer Flynn said: Drunk driving continues because people aren't afraid not to. Punishments are not that big of a deal. They are not severe enough because society doesn't view it as the crime it should... Katie's head was severed from her body. The entire front end was embedded in Stanley Rabinowitz. To clean it up and water it down so it's more palatable for the papers and the news, the jury and the defendant is wrong. In 2010, Jennifer and Neil Flynn took part in an anti-drunk driving campaign in New York state, describing the terrible impact of Katie's death." 2018 "Mar" 3 2000

"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/spanish-woman-fatal-elevator-accident/" "mixture" "A web site posted an unclear translation of a news account about a grisly incident that killed a Spanish woman in a hospital shortly after she gave birth." "Arturo Garcia" 2017-08-23 "A woman in Sevilla, Spain, was \"cut in half\" in a fatal elevator accident in a hospital that occurred shortly after she gave birth." "A woman in Sevilla, Spain, was killed in a fatal elevator accident in a hospital that occurred while she was being taken to her room after a caesarean section. The unfortunate victim succumbed to head injuries; she was not \"cut in half.\" On 20 August 2017, a blog post on the web site Science 2.0 reproduced a grisly news story out of Spain that opened as follows: A woman coming from a caesarean section in the Valme hospital died, trapped by an elevator She spent two hours with her feet dangling in the elevator shaft until she was rescued by firefighters A 25-year-old Gypsy woman, who had just left the waking room after giving birth (a caesarean section was performed), has died this afternoon when her body was severed by an elevator at Valme's hospital in Seville while she Was being transferred with the baby in bed from the second floor to the third, where Maternity is located, according to the union Csi-f. Science 2.0 reason for reproducing this tragic account was an apparent protest against the practices of the British \"gutter press\" and recent legal changes affecting the presentation of Spanish news reports via Google: A woman has died in a tragic accident shortly after giving birth by caesarean section. It is unfortunate that, due to a new Spanish Law which requires media to invoice Google for even a small snippet of copyright material, Google no longer feeds Spanish news to its Google News pages. In consequence of that law, it falls to English-speaking journalists to tell the world about events in Spain. That would not be a problem except for the fact that the papers which first picked up this story constitute Britain's gutter press. They have sensationalised and distorted this tragic event for the sake of click-bait headlines and their commercial bottom line. The accident referenced in that post did take place: 25-year-old Rocío Cortés was killed in a freak accident at Hospital de Valme in Sevilla, Spain on 19 August 2017. She was being taken into an elevator en route to her room after giving birth to her third child when the elevator began going up, even though Cortés had not been fully placed inside. Her head was subsequently trapped in the elevator shaft, killing her. Hospital officials attributed Cortés' death to a \"severe cranial trauma\" and said that the elevator had passed an inspection on 12 August 2017. Her family sued not only the hospital but the company that evaluated the elevator. However, Science 2.0 did not directly translate the Spanish news reporting; rather, they ran an online translation stating that Cortés' \"body was severed,\" an unclear wording that led to claims the unfortunate victim had been \"cut in half.\" Other news outlets reported more specifically that Cortés was \"decapitated\" or that her head was crushed. Science 2.0 elaborated on how their sharing the account of Cortés' death related to the site's ostensible subject matter: What this has to do with science is — science cannot thrive without accurate reporting. By showing how some media sensationalises and distorts I hope to show evidence of British news sources not to be trusted in matters scientific, such as climate change. But besides not citing any specific examples of British news outlets misrepresenting the story of Cortés' fatal accident, Science 2.0 didn't demonstrate that her death had been obscured by Google News' lack of Spanish news in their newsfeed. A search of Google itself provided several examples of Spanish news sites' covering the story, and searching for Cortés' name turned up coverage of her death published by English-language news media outlets." 2017 "Aug" 8 2010

Seriously injured, the victim managed to crawl to a nearby road, where she was found and taken to a hospital. She told police her friends had attacked her. The other two girls were arrested and charged with attempted first-degree intentional homicide. The attack weapon was found among their belongings. They admitted to planning and executing the crime. Under interrogation, they claimed they did it to appease a supernatural being called Slenderman (aka Slender Man), who was described in a Newsweek article as \"an evil character who lives only on the Internet,\" but in whom the accused attackers said they fervently believed: According to the criminal complaint obtained by Newsweek, Morgan Geyser and Anissa Weier, both 12, discovered Slender Man on Creepypasta Wiki, a website dedicated to Internet horror stories (its tagline: “Proudly hosting 12,151 of your worst nightmares since 2010”). They believed he was real. In early 2014, Geyser and Weier decided to become what they called “proxies” of Slender Man, thereby proving their dedication to him and his existence to skeptics. To do so, they’d have to kill someone. Although months in the planning, their mission did not succeed. The victim, Payton Leutner, recovered, though she still lives in fear for her life, her mother says. The accused were tried as adults and pleaded guilty to the attack but argued in court they weren't responsible for their actions due to mental illness. In December 2017, Weier was sentenced to 25 years in a psychiatric institution. Geyser has yet to face sentencing. The incident was cast as a cautionary tale for parents by Waukesha police chief Rus­sell Jack, who cited it as a consequence of allowing children unsupervised access to the Internet: Keeping children safe is more challenging than in years past. The Internet has changed the way we live. It is full of information and wonderful sites that teach and entertain. The Internet can also be full of dark and wicked things. But although it's true there are \"dark and wicked things\" to be found on the Internet (as in life, generally), and children's use of the Internet ought indeed to be supervised, to suggest that the Slenderman materials viewed by the accused are \"wicked,\" in any deeper sense than, say, a Stephen King novel is \"wicked,\" is to misunderstand them. The Slenderman \"mythos,\" as the accumulated stories, images, and commentary related to the character have come to be called, is a blend of fiction and folklore. It's a crowd-sourced horror story that hearkens back to boogeyman tales of old. The first time the name \"Slender Man\" appeared anywhere in print or on screen was on the entertainment web site SomethingAwful.com on 10 June 2009. Someone started a thread in a discussion forum, essentially a Photoshop contest, entitled \"Create Paranormal Images.\" Among the early entries was one posted under the pseudonym \"Victor Surge\" (later identified as member Eric Knudsen), consisting of an old photograph manipulated to depict a tall, faceless human-like figure with tentacle-like arms lurking in the shadows near a children's playground: 
One of two recovered photographs from the Stirling City Library blaze. Notable for being taken the day which fourteen children vanished and for what is referred to as \"The Slender Man\". Deformities cited as film defects by officials. Fire at library occurred one week later. Actual photograph confiscated as evidence. 1986, photographer: Mary Thomas, missing since June 13th, 1986. The effect was understated, yet creepy. Inspired by the example, others contributed photos and backstory expanding on Surge's themes, and piecemeal construction of the Slenderman mythos, a collaborative project from the start, was underway. As Surge himself suggested, it was also, from the start, a patchwork of cultural influences: Where did you get the source for Slender Man? Or was he done from a scratch? The Slender Man as an idea was made-up off the top of my head, although the concept is based on a number of things that scare me. The name I thought up on the fly when I wrote that first bit. The asset I used for a couple of the pictures was the creepy tall guy from Phantasm, which sadly I have not seen, and the others various guys in suits. All of the things that aren't the torso and legs, like the tentacles and Slender Man's face, were painted from scratch however. By the time middle-schoolers Morgan Geyser and Anissa Weier encountered the Slenderman character years later, the mythos had grown considerably and was being archived on fan sites like Creepypasta Wiki (creepypasta\" being an Internet slang term for user-created horror stories and images). It's where, for example, the girls would have read that Slenderman uses fear to control people's minds, and then kills them: He is described as wearing a black suit strikingly similar to the visage of the notorious Men In Black, and as the name suggests, appears very thin and able to stretch his limbs and torso to inhuman lengths in order to induce fear and ensnare his prey. Once his arms are outstretched, his victims are put into something of a hypnotized state, where they are utterly helpless to stop themselves from walking into them. He is also able to create tendrils from his fingers and back that he uses to walk on in a similar fashion to Doctor Octopus. The superhuman stretching ability could also be seen as a similarity between himself and Mr. Fantastic. Whether he absorbs, kills, or merely takes his victims to an undisclosed location or dimension is also unknown as there are never any bodies or evidence left behind in his wake to deduce a definite conclusion. It's also where they would have learned what a Slenderman \"proxy\" is: Proxy (plural: Proxies) is the term given to those who serve The Slender Man. The theory behind the name is that Proxies are entities or people who are under the influence or control of the Slender Man (or the same force that influences Slender Man), and act based on its wants and needs — hence, Proxies serve as an in-between (i.e. a proxy) for Slender Man. And it's where they would have been introduced to \"evidence\" that Slenderman sightings date back to the 16th-century in Germany, where woodcuts documenting reports of a murderous so-called \"Tall Man\" (Der Großmann) with a spear-like arm and superfluous legs were allegedly found:" 2017 "Jan" 1 1980

"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/raggedy-ann-vaccine-death/" "mostly false" "Raggedy Ann's creator filed patents for the doll several months before his daughter fell ill and died, rendering an old claim about vaccines chronologically impossible." "Kim LaCapria" 2017-01-11 "Raggedy Ann dolls were created by a grief-stricken father who lost his daughter to a vaccine-related illness, and who wished to broadcast the risks of vaccination." "Raggedy Ann was created in 1915 by Johnny Gruelle, whose daughter Marcella died at the age of 13 after receiving a vaccination. Raggedy Ann was patented before Marcella's death and had nothing to do with vaccine opposition. In January 2017, Facebook pages \"The Truth About Vaccines\" and \"VacTruth.com\" shared memes promotion the notion that the Raggedy Ann and Andy dolls were created as part of an anti-vaccination movement:  Different versions of this claim had appeared as early as 2009, and the alternative health site RealFarmacy published a 2014 article that linked Raggedy Ann with a death caused (they said) by vaccination: In 1921, Johnny Gruelle's 8-yr old daughter was vaccinated in school without her parents' permission. Between the time she became ill from the vaccination and her death a few months later, her body was completely limp, like a rag doll. It was this sick vaccine-injured child that inspired Gruelle to create the Raggedy Ann doll. This myth was hinted at by the Wall Street Journal in February 2015. In general, the memes and articles advanced the claim that Raggedy Ann dolls were created by Johnny Gruelle in 1915 as symbols of the dangers and deaths purportedly associated with vaccines. The rumor clearly had sticking power and regularly made the rounds on social media, and although aspects of it may be correct, the gist of the \"vaccination\" claim is easily disputed. Historians at doll enthusiast site DollKind.com noted that Gruelle's purported creation of a \"dead\" and \"lifeless\" tribute to his daughter with X marks over the doll's eyes were \"absurd\": Raggedy Ann has been historically associated with the anti-vaccination movement, and there is some truth and some fiction associated with this belief. The tragic truth that still wrenches our hearts to this day is that Johnny Gruelle's little daughter died after being given a mandatory smallpox vaccination at school. The child was just 13 years old, and her loss was devastating to Johnny Gruelle, who then became a proponent of the anti-vaccination movement. However, there is an absurd school of thought that asserts that the Raggedy Ann doll was created as a limp and lifeless-looking creature to symbolize Gruelle's dead child. This is certainly not the case, and Gruelle's registered patent of the Raggedy Ann character occurred right around the time of Marcella's death. Evidence indicates that he had been working on perfecting Raggedy Ann prior to this tragedy in his family. On the Raggedy Land web site, author Patricia Hall noted that the legend was one of many associated with Raggedy Ann, a brand popular with children for several decades: Johnny Gruelle's little rag dolls have also found themselves at the center of several legend cycles -- groups of stories that, while containing kernels of truth, are more myth than they are history. What makes this even more intriguing is that fact that Johnny Gruelle, either unwittingly or with the great sense of humor he was known for, initiated many of these legends, a number of which are continuously repeated as the factual history of Raggedy Ann and Andy. According to that site, plans for what would become an extremely popular rag doll were well underway when Marcella becae ill and died of an infection at the site of a previously administered vaccination: When the real-life Marcella Gruelle died, at age 13, from the ravages of an infected vaccination, her parents were, understandably devastated. Under different circumstances, this would have been a time of great rejoicing for Gruelle and his family. He was connecting with juvenile publishers, and was working on several sets of illustrated fairy stories. In November (the same month of Marcella's death) Gruelle had been granted final approval by the U.S. Patent office for his doll called \"Raggedy Ann.\" But all was overshadowed by the death of his beloved daughter. As both doll historians stated, Marcella died not because of a vaccination, but possibly because of an infection related to the vaccination. Advances in medical sterilization and clinical protocols suggest a death like Marcella's would be highly implausible under typical circumstances more than a century later. Antibiotics and sterilization changed dramatically between the 20th and the 21st centuries. No honest comparison could be drawn between medicine in 1915 and 2017, as illustrated by Centers for Disease Control statistics (unrelated to vaccines): At the beginning of the 20th century, for every 1000 live births, six to nine women in the United States died of pregnancy-related complications, and approximately 100 infants died before age 1 year (1,2). From 1915 through 1997, the infant mortality rate declined greater than 90% to 7.2 per 1000 live births, and from 1900 through 1997, the maternal mortality rate declined almost 99% to less than 0.1 reported death per 1000 live births (7.7 deaths per 100,000 live births in 1997). Environmental interventions, improvements in nutrition, advances in clinical medicine, improvements in access to health care, improvements in surveillance and monitoring of disease, increases in education levels, and improvements in standards of living contributed to this remarkable decline. Despite these improvements in maternal and infant mortality rates, significant disparities by race and ethnicity persist. This report summarizes trends in reducing infant and maternal mortality in the United States, factors contributing to these trends, challenges in reducing infant and maternal mortality, and provides suggestions for public health action for the 21st century. Both Doll Kind and Hall's myths about Raggedy Ann's origins were well circulated, and Marcella's death is an integral part of the doll's apocrypha. However, Johnny Gruelle filed his patent for the dolls on 28 May 1915 and received it on 7 November 1915. Marcella coincidentally passed away on 8 November 1915, one day after her father's patent was granted. Given that Gruelle filed the patent several months before his daughter died, it is impossible that he created the dolls as a response to his daughter's death. Raggedy Ann was in the works long before Marcella received any vaccinations, became ill, or died." 2017 "Jan" 1 1000

"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/spider-bursts-out-of-overripe-banana/" "false" "A viral video of a spider breaking out of a banana skin is an animation created by a talented CGI artist." "Bethania Palma" 2016-09-20 "A video captures a large spider that survived inside a banana until it burst out of the peel by its own power." "On 12 June 2015, a computer graphics wunderkind by the name of Kaleb Lechowski uploaded a video to YouTube that seeming showed a rather large spider breaking out of a banana skin in the same manner that a chick fights its way out of an egg shell:  In September 2016, that video began making the rounds online and left many viewers wondering whether it was real. That was easily determined by noting that the end of the video included a copyright notice crediting Lechowski, who first drew public attention with the 2013 dystopian animated short film \"R'ha.\" That film was so convincingly animated that Lechowski captured the attention of Hollywood: Despite being the work of a student, R'ha is so good it's already attracted the attention of Hollywood executives. After seeing Lechowski's creation online, Scott Glassgold, of the managing company IAM Sports & Entertainment, was impressed. \"His work is not only professional, it's extraordinary,\" Glassgold [said]. \"There are shots in there that look like they are from a 150-million-dollar movie.\" Glassgold has experience with science fiction, [and] he sold the shorts Rosa and True Skin to studios last year. Lechowski is currently in the process of turning \"R'ha\" into a full-length film. The short, which was shared widely across the Internet, tells a dark, futuristic story of a planet inhabited by machines enslaved by lizard-like aliens who rebel against their captors. In the film, a machine interrogates an alien using electrical shock as a mechanism of torture. Aside from his background as a CGI artist, Lechowski's YouTube page seems to indicate that he either has a penchant for creating animated insects, or he has a major infestation problem in his apartment. One video shows a very large centipede-like insect crawling out of a speaker, while another depicts a spider roughly the size of his hand hanging out on his wall. In yet another video, he throws an object at his wall to scatter a virtual colony of spiders. Lechowski is a resident of Berlin, Germany, and according to Mashable, was educated at Berlin's Mediadesign Hochschule. When the banana video was released in 2015, Lechowski acknowledged it was fake: I used a chopstick to pierce the banana from behind. Then I removed the stick from the image and inserted a spider that I created, using Blender, the 3D software. There's no doubt Lechowski has a promising career ahead of him in cinema and animation, as long as he doesn't get overrun by the apparent virtual insect farm in his apartment." 2016 "Sep" 9 2010

"Bethania Palma" 2016-09-09 "A photograph taken by a responding police officer shows a couple passed out in their vehicle from a suspected heroin overdose, with their child in the back seat." "On 9 September 2016, a photograph of two adults passed out in the front seat of their car with a small child in the back seat hit social media. The photograph is legitimate and was taken by an East Liverpool, Ohio, police officer who had stopped the car after seeing it being driven erratically. The city of East Liverpool posted pictures showing the driver and an adult passenger, James Acord and Rhonda Pasek respectively, looking extremely pale, limp and unconscious in the front seat of the vehicle. A little blond boy can be seen behind them in the back seat: Brian Allen, the city's director of public safety, confirmed to us that the photograph is real. Both adults survived and have been charged with crimes, and the child has been taken into protective custody. Acord has been convicted of operating a vehicle under the influence and Pasek has been charged with child endangerment and drug use, Allen told us. Acord and Pasek were presumed to have been under the influence of heroin, but blood test results are still pending. The city posted the photograph and a copy of the incident report to their official Facebook page with the following cautionary message: We feel it necessary to show the other side of this horrible drug. We feel we need to be a voice for the children caught up in this horrible mess. This child can't speak for himself but we are hopeful his story can convince another user to think twice about injecting this poison while having a child in their custody. According to the report posted by the city, on 7 September 2016, just after 3 p.m. local time, Kevin Thompson, a police officer for the city of East Liverpool, noticed a dark Ford Explorer driving erratically toward a bus full of schoolchildren. After the car skidded to a stop, it drifted a little before coming to a stop again. Thompson wrote in his report that he had to turn off the engine and take the keys out of the ignition to prevent the driver from continuing on. Thompson said when he tried talking to Acord, his head was bobbing, his pupils were pinpoint, and his speech was slurred. Thompson wrote that Acord said he was attempting to take Pasek to the hospital, but during the conversation, Acord went totally unconscious. Thompson noticed Pasek was turning blue and tried to assist her while he called for an ambulance. Thompson also wrote that he saw paramedics administer the anti-narcotic Narcan, which enabled both adults to regain consciousness before they were transported to the hospital.

"David Mikkelson" 2016-08-14 "A young woman named Elisa Lam disappeared under mysterious circumstances in Los Angeles, her body later found in a hotel's water tank." "On 31 January 2013, Canadian student Elisa Lam was last seen alive by an employee of the Hotel Cecil in Los Angeles. Lam disappeared on that day, and she remained missing for several weeks after she failed to check out of the property as scheduled in February 2013. On 6 February 2013, the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) released information about the disappearance of Elisa Lam in the hopes of finding her alive, and on the following day held a press conference on the case that was covered in local and national news. On 14 February 2013, surveillance video from the Hotel Cecil in Los Angeles was released by police; in those lengthy clips, Lam was seen lingering in an elevator and behaving in an unusual fashion. Many viewers of the unsettling clips inferred Lam was interacting with an unknown person or persons off camera, while others suspected the young woman was experiencing an episode of acute mental illness or was under the influence of drugs Five days after the release of the videos, the hotel began to investigate guest complaints of low water pressure and an odd taste in the water supply, and maintenance workers located a body, later identified as that of Elisa Lam, in one of four large water tanks on the roof of the Hotel Cecil. The next day, public health officials issued a \"do not drink\" advisory to hotel guests pending testing of the water to determine whether it was safe to use. In June 2013, Lt. Fred Corral of the Los Angeles County coroner's office investigations division confirmed Elisa Lam's cause of death was accidental, with bipolar disorder as a significant condition. The location of Lam's body (inside a hard-to-access water tank) and her odd behavior were among mysteries not resolved when the forensic investigation was completed: Those test results were initially expected to take six to eight weeks to complete, but coroner's spokesman Ed Winter said in response to queries that the office was still awaiting complete testing results. Corral said no other information on the cause of death or condition of the woman's body was being released. Authorities including police and the coroner have not stated how they believe Lam got into the tank. Law enforcement officials had been careful to say that the death could be accidental, despite widespread public suspicions of foul play. In the time since Elisa Lam's mysterious death, the enduring questions she left behind have been the source of speculation. Adding to the uneasiness many have about Lam's demise is the checkered history of the Hotel Cecil, where a woman leapt to her death from the roof in the 1960s and serial killer Richard Ramirez (the \"Night Stalker\") lived for a time in the mid-1980s. One of the aspects of the Elisa Lam's disappearance and death that has fed continuing interest in the case is its trajectory and unresolved aspects. Given that Lam was initially one of a number of missing students at the time, her disappearance didn't draw much attention until the release of surveillance video by the LAPD in February 2013. Even then, it wasn't until the unusual circumstances of her death by drowning were revealed that media interest in Lam's case surged. Contrary to later retellings, Lam's death made headlines both locally and internationally. Another matter of interest to the public was that even police were stumped as to how Lam's body came to end up in a water tank that is difficult to access. Foul play was initially investigated as a possibility, but the coroner's office ruled Lam's death to be an accidental one: The mysterious death of the young woman whose body was found in a water tank on the roof of a cheap downtown hotel has been ruled accidental. The Los Angeles County coroner's office issued the ruling in the case of Elisa Lam, Lt. Fred Corral of the coroner's investigations division said. The cause of death was listed as accidental due to drowning, with bipolar disorder listed as a significant condition, he said." 2016 "Aug" 8 2010

"Kim LaCapria" 2016-05-11 "A Texas man found a dead rat in a partially consumed bottle of Dr Pepper." "On 9 May 2016, a Texas man named John Graves published several photographs to Facebook alongside a claim that he had discovered a dead rat in his grandson's partially-consumed bottle of Dr Pepper:  Graves' status update read: Nothing like your grandson drinking half a Dr Pepper only to find a dead rat floating on the bottle. Response from Dr Pepper was.....\"send us the bottle and we will let you know something in 6-8 weeks!\" Are you kidding me? What if my grandson drank poison or disease? This was purchased in Galveston yesterday at Valero on 39th and Broadway. Beware people. Way to stand behind your products Dr Pepper. On 9 May 2016 Graves provided further details about his claim to Houston news outlet KPRC, stating that the rat went unnoticed for a day after his three-year-old grandson opened and consumed half of the bottle of soda. Graves didn't indicate that the soft drink tasted different or that any note was taken of the (fairly large) rodent's presence inside the bottle, and Graves himself said the rat was a \"pretty good size\": John Graves of Katy said his 3-year-old grandson, Kayden, drank the Dr Pepper on Sunday after they bought it in Galveston. The boy was given the soft drink while he sat in his car seat. He didn’t finish it, so they put the cap back on. When they opened the 20-ounce bottle the next morning, they found a rodent floating inside. “Pretty good size. About 3 inches long, with a big tail,” Graves said. They immediately took Kayden to his pediatrician to undergo some tests. Blood and urine samples were taken, and the state of Texas and the Centers for Disease Control were contact. They are now waiting for the results. Graves said that a Dr Pepper spokesperson requested the bottle and rat be submitted to the company for testing, but that he was concerned about maintaining the sample's integrity and sought an independent analysis of the specimen: The family also contacted Dr Pepper. A spokesperson told them and KPRC 2 that they want the bottle so they can run tests on it ... the Graves family wants to have its own testing done before handing the bottle over to Dr Pepper's people. \"I want to get the rat tested to see where it came from, how it got there, if there is any medical concerns we should be concerned about,\" Graves said. “There is no telling what could happen to that sample.” As of Tuesday, the family was working with Dr Pepper to figure out if the rodent could be sent to an independent lab in Houston. Dr Pepper tells Channel 2 it would be happy to send the rodent to a qualified lab in Texas; however, at this point the only qualified lab the company is aware of is Alteca LTD in Kansas. Food safety expert Jay Neal told the outlet that it was possible (but not probable) that a rodent could wind up in a sealed bottle of soda, noting that rats and mice were capable of entering small spaces. While Neal said the claim could be accurate, he also explained why it was an unlikely scenario, noting a small window during which such contamination could occur: It’s washing the bottle, it’s filling the bottle, it’s putting the cap on the bottle, it’s putting the label on the bottle, all in less than 15 seconds[.] In response to the viral controversy, Dr Pepper released a statement that described the claim as \"virtually impossible\" and that testing would take six to eight weeks from the date of receipt. In their statement, the brand maintained that the laboratory would be an independent third party (as Graves said he sought): Nothing is more important to us than the safety and well-being of our consumers. We take all consumer complaints very seriously, are very concerned about the call we received today from Mr. Graves and are investigating it as best as we can. What we know from our experience is that given the controls and safeguards we have in our production facilities it is virtually impossible for any foreign object to enter any container during the bottling process. All of our containers enter our facility on pallets in our warehouse and remain covered until the moment they are placed on our high-speed filling lines. Once on the filling lines, they are inverted and rinsed out before they are filled and capped. We have offered to dispatch a courier to pick up the product to take it out for testing by a third party forensics laboratory, but the consumer has declined this request. This lab would be able to analyze any rodent that got into the product, determine how it entered the container and even inspect the contents of its stomach. This process can take 6-8 weeks to yield conclusive findings. Until we have the opportunity to review the contents, we don’t have a way to do a full investigation.” While Graves' story has not been explicitly disproven, skeptics pointed out that it showed many similarities to a man's 2015 claim that KFC served him a battered, fried rat, a story that was later revealed to be a hoax. It was also similar to a woman's 2005 claim that she discovered a severed finger in Wendy's chili, which later unraveled under scrutiny. Yet another, similar claim was disproven after experts said that Mountain Dew (and other soft drinks) could dissolve a mouse, thanks to the acids that incorporated into their flavoring agents to give them a tanginess and bite. In this case, the rat depicted appeared merely to be drowned, but in no way visibly decomposed. As of 11 May 2016, Dr Pepper dispatched a courier to Graves' location to collect the rat and purportedly contaminated Dr. Pepper bottle for independent third-party testing; Graves refused the pickup attempt. No information is currently available as to whether Graves and the brand managed to come to an agreement about circumstances under which the specimen could be tested, and the claim remains unproven." 2016 "May" 5 2000

"Kim LaCapria" 2016-04-06 "An ISIS attack claimed seven lives in a U.S. town." "In April 2016, social media rumors began spreading that involved headlines which partially read \"Dead by ISIS\". However, the location of the purported attacks (and number of people allegedly killed) varied tremendously. One version involved Eugene, Oregon, and reported that 27 people were killed by ISIS militants: Eugene – Islamic State group militants reportedly attacked city killing 27 people. According to police, the militants — also known as ISIS or ISIL — also claimed they posted photos online of their fighters standing in the city’s main government complex. “They used six suicide vehicles followed by a commando of fighters wearing explosive belts,” an unidentified military source told police. “They managed to take control of the base when the army had to pull out because it suffered casualties. … Our forces have since counter-attacked and retaken control, with aerial coalition backing.” Local police were working to clear the city of explosives and break up pockets of resistance. About 700 ISIS fighters were thought to be hiding in the city. Details about ISIS attack (or attacks) were scarce and often contradictory. police reported that ISIS said it captured 11 army bases, which the Iraqi army has said is false. It didn't take much skepticism to observe such a development would immediately become a focal point in national news, no matter where in the United States it happened. However, the only news of the purported ISIS attacks came from one web site: World Current Events. The page's sidebar listed nearly identical headlines for claims involving similar ISIS attacks in a number of locations, suggesting that the site's sole purpose was to spread fake stories about mass murders. While the claims escalated in popularity in April 2016, they appeared on social media as early as 1 February 2016: https://t.co/bgeubPdqZ2 — Roland Enetorp (@EnetorpRoland) February 1, 2016 JUST IN; 7 dead, 11 wounded by ISIS in Dallas https://t.co/xT8AvyM4vX — Road Alerts (@RoadAlertsKE) February 5, 2016  The image used on the Eugene, Oregon page was originally published on 15 March 2013, and was not related to any ISIS invasion or attack in the area. The same was true for a British version of the claim, for which the image was swiped from an unrelated August 2015 news story: A version set in California used a news photo from an unrelated January 2014 incident: World Current Events featured no disclaimer notice warning readers that its content was not to be trusted, and aside from ISIS-related fake news articles the site hosted no information at all. The site followed a spate of fake celebrity news stories from similar fake news generator sites including McKenzie Post, Headline Brief, WCPM 3 News, WLEB 21, and FeedNewz, the primary purpose of which involved fabricating stories to drive traffic (and ad revenue) through social media shares. But while the other prank generators stuck to fairly benign fake headlines about popular chains closing for good, celebrity moves to small towns, and stars getting nearby flat tires, World Current Events published false claims of a disturbing and frightening nature." 2016 "Apr" 4 2010

"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/ecstasy-halloween-candy/" "mostly false" "Despite Facebook warnings, there's little reason to expect drug-laced Gummi bears and Ecstasy tablets will be found in kids' trick-or-treat bags this Halloween." "Kim LaCapria" 2015-09-28 "Parents should keep any eye out for drug-laced Gummy bears and ecstasy (MDMA) disguised as Halloween candy being distributed to trick-or-treaters." "Some forms of Ecstasy are brightly colored and look like candy. These forms of Ecstasy are not \"new,\" they're not intended to appeal to children, and they're not likely to end up in kids' Halloween trick-or-treat bags. In September 2015, many Facebook users shared photographs along with warnings that the images depicted a \"new shapes of Ecstasy\" that \"can kill kids through overdoses,\" and therefore parents should be vigilant to ensure no such items turned up in their children's trick-or-treat bags on Halloween: If your kids get these for Halloween candy, they ARE NOT CANDY!!! They are the new shapes of \"Ecstasy\" and can kill kids through overdoses!!! So, check your kid's candy and \"When in doubt, Throw it out!!!\" Be safe and always keep the shiny side up!!! Many of the readers commenting on the photographs observed that the substance depicted appeared to be MDMA (colloquially called \"ecstasy\", \"X\", \"E\", or \"Molly\" for its more potent form), a popular party drug recognized partly by its colorful and candy-like appearance:   The \"ecstasy in Halloween candy\" warning appeared to be a variant of age-old rumors about poison (and other dangerous substances) being randomly handed out to children in trick-or-treat loot, a persistent but largely baseless fear that's dogged Halloween celebrations for decades. Despite long-held beliefs that Halloween candy tampering is both commonplace and regularly results in harm to children, reports of actual attempts to do so are virtually non-existent (or based on half-truths). Excessive concern over colorful drugs (such as strawberry meth) either making their way into the hands of kids or being manufactured to appeal to them isn't a new concern either: tales circulated in the 1970s claiming LSD merchants were targeting children by peddling their wares via attractive temporary tattoos. By sharp contrast, dire warnings about drugs designed with a candy-like appearance intended to \"hook\" kids have never come true — which stands to reason, as schoolchildren aren't the most promising market for illicit recreational drugs. (LSD and MDMA also are largely not addictive substances.) As is often the case with such rumors, the public seemed to conflate the existence of a drug that looked child-friendly (such as blue star tattoos, pink meth, or colorful MDMA tablets) with deliberate manufacture of those substances with an intent to attract children. Prior to its September 2015 circulation on social media as a cautionary tale, the photograph of Ecstasy used here appeared primarily on blogs discussing (presumably adult) recreational drug use. An important distinction to bear in mind is that the MDMA depicted is not a new form designed to appeal to children: MDMA tablets have historically been produced with a variety of shapes and colors befitting its status as a \"party drug.\" Another is that recreational drugs (including MDMA) are generally expensive. The small collection of pills depicted here represents a street value of hundreds of dollars, so the notion that a neighbor would be distributing them to trick-or-treaters for no ostensible reason is rather implausible (especially given how many drug users tend to carefully guard their stashes and often won't readily share them with friends, much less randomly-selected small children). So while the image of Ecstasy circulating on Facebook might at first appear to represent a true threat to kids on Halloween, there's little reason to suspect Molly will be lurking in any plastic pumpkins this year. Another related rumor warned parents of the potential for deadly, drug-laced, oversized Gummy bears being handed out to unknowing children on Halloween: This warning didn't even specify the name or type of drug that these Gummi bears supposedly harbored, but we're pretty sure drugs that cause \"brain death and/or death\" have few aficionados — and even fewer repeat users. Nonetheless, on 19 October 2015, police in Jackson, Mississippi, shared the popular \"warning\" about MDMA in Halloween candy. That claim was subsequently aggregated to blogs and news web sites as an \"urgent Halloween warning\" from police (not as repetition of a dubious, ancient urban legend): Police warn if you get these in your trick-or-treat bag, they're not candy. https://t.co/knBDVIOc48 pic.twitter.com/r3ygkWckjB — AJC (@ajc) October 21, 2015  In May 2017, a similar warning about \"pink teddy bear\" ecstasy tablets began spreading on Facebook: PLEASE SHOW THIS TO YOUR KIDS AND WARN THEM NOT TO TAKE THIS FROM THERE FRIENDS BECAUSE IT IS NOT CANDY!!! IT IS ECSTASY!!! PLEASE FORWARD TO EVERYONE YOU KNOW!!!  Once again, images of MDMA tablets were taken out of their original context and presented as a tactic used by drug dealers to entice children. The image of the tablets in a bag first appeared on MDMA-related sites in 2016 (captioned \"Purple Bears w/ 180mg MDMA\") aimed not at children, but at users of the substance. In March 2017, the British Sun tabloid utilized the same \"stock image\" in a news story about four young teenagers hospitalized after purportedly ingesting teddy bear-shaped MDMA tablets: FOUR schoolgirls, 13, were taken to hospital after “taking teddy bear ecstasy pills” in Manchester. The youngsters swallowed the pink, “teddy bear” pills near the Civic Centre in Wythenshawe, and were admitted to hospital [in March 2017], police have said. Sky News and the BBC also covered the incident, and all reports indicated the teenagers willingly ingested the \"teddy bear ecstasy\" as a recreational drug (not because the unknowingly believed it to be candy). A December 2016 warning issued in <a href=\"https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/pink-teddy-bear-ecstasy-warning-12356013\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Wales</a> also pertained to (adult) individuals who had been hospitalized as a possible result of taking the tablets, once again as a recreational drug. Although the image of pink teddy bear ecstasy appeared to be genuine and unaltered, there was still no evidence even one child had been tricked into consuming MDMA because it looked like candy. Warnings issued about the MDMA variant largely pertained to hospitalizations believed to have been caused by it, not its distribution to unwitting children." 2015 "Sep" 9 2010

"David Mikkelson" 2015-05-16 "A hotel restaurant in Nigeria was found to be selling human meat." "Claim: A hotel restaurant in Nigeria was found to be selling human meat. MIXTURE   Example: [Collected via e-mail, May 2005]  Origins: On 5 September 2013, the Nigerian tabloid Osun Defender published a grisly account (sourced from the Naija Loaded forum) about a local hotel that had been shut down after reports surfaced that its restaurant was selling dishes made of human meat, with police reportedly recovering two fresh cellophane-wrapped human heads at the scene:  The arrest followed tip-offs from area residents on Thursday morning. The hotel owner, 6 women and 4 men were arrested. After police got access to the hotel, they made a startling discovery of two human heads wrapped in a cellophane bag, two AK47 rifles, two army caps, 40 rounds of live ammunition and so many cell phones. \"Each time I came to market, because the hotel is very close to the market, I always noticed funny movements in and out of the hotel; dirty people with dirty characters always come into the hotel. So, I was not surprised when the police made this discovery in the early hours of yesterday,\" said a vegetable seller in the area A Pastor who was among the people who tipped off the police on Thursday said: \"I went to the hotel early this year, after eating, I was told that a lump of meat was being sold at N700, I was surprised. So I did not know it was human meat that I ate at such expensive price.\"
 This account was widely picked up by many western news outlets in February 2014, including the New York Daily News, the International Business Times, the Independent, Metro, and Gawker, all of whom unquestioningly reported it as straight news. This two-year-old story inexplicably got a boost when it was repeated on the Swahili-language section of the BBC's web site on 13 May 2015 and was picked up again from there by western press outlets (such as the Daily Mail) a few days later. But was it true? The original report included several typical signs of fake news:    \"Each time I came to market, because the hotel is very close to the market, I always noticed funny movements in and out of the hotel; dirty people with dirty characters always come into the hotel. So, I was not surprised when the police made this discovery in the early hours of yesterday,\" said a vegetable seller in the area A Pastor who was among the people who tipped off the police on Thursday said: \"I went to the hotel early this year, after eating, I was told that a lump of meat was being sold at N700, I was surprised.

 All in all, what we had was the western press repeating a single-source story which a Nigerian tabloid had picked up from an online forum.
However, overlooked in all that initial U.S. and UK reporting was that other news sources, such as the Nigerian Tribune, had also contemporaneously reported the same event, with additional verifiable details that suggested there might be something to the story:  Though the Onitsha Area Commander, Mr Benjamin Wordu, declined further comments on the matter on the grounds that the police was still investigating the case to make further discovery, it was gathered that during the operation, an Infiniti SUV, belonging to the owner of the hotel, with registration number DA203FST was also recovered. Meanwhile, the Anambra State Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), DSP Emeka Chukwuemeka, confirmed the incident and said the police had intensified manhunt to arrest all members of the cartel.
 Here we have various law enforcement officials cited and referenced by name, which lends a degree of versimilitude to the story. But all that such reports confirmed was that a raid on the hotel took place, not necessarily that the shocking claims about human meat being served up to unsuspecting restaurant patrons were true. A 29 December 2013 article from the Nigerian publication Vanguard quoted the hotel's owner, Bonaventure Mokwe, as asserting that he had been set up over a motor park dispute between him and some Onitsha natives. According to Mr. Mokwe, his business rivals planted two rotten skulls (as well as rifles and magazines) in one of his hotel's rooms, and the rumors of human being served to guests were a fabricated excuse that police used to raid the hotel, arrest Mr. Mokwe, put him on trial for murder, and ultimately demolish his hotel:  Within the period , I wrote the Obi of Onitsha three times asking him to intervene and call the natives to order but he remained understandably silent. When that failed, I wrote a petition to the Anambra State Commissioner of Police which he minuted to the Onitsha Area Commander who in turn assigned an Inspector to investigate. But these efforts ended as soon as they started. When that failed again, I went to court and obtained an order which was served on the palace of Obi of Onitsha, the police and leaders of the Onitsha natives antagonising me. Soon after some bus drivers started loading in my park and all hell broke loose, as threats of all dimension started coming from the Onitsha natives which culminated in the planting of the exhibits in my hotel. The human skulls and magazines were parked in a sac and planted in the wardrobe at my hotel lodging room number 102. I drove into my office around 7 am that fateful day because I had a land transaction. Before I could settle down, my hotel was surrounded by the police numbering over 100. As I made my way towards my office entrance, some of them were already in the passage. I was taken into my office and shown a search warrant. In the process, one police officer betrayed the whole adventure when he shouted at one of my staff to be shown room 102. It did not make sense to me then. The first thing I saw when the door of the room was opened was an unsealed traveling bag on the floor. Some polythene bags were inside the bag and two on the bed. Nothing was found in the toilet and under the bed. The police then opened the wardrobe of the room and brought out one single Bagco sac, in which were two rotten skulls, two A.K-47 rifles that looked unserviceable and two loaded magazines. The mock search exercise started and ended after five minutes or thereabouts at the door of room 102. Incidentally the lodger locked the room and left with the key around 6.30 am, following which the police showed up. I was immediately handcuffed and taken outside the corridor of the hotel, where I was told to sit next to the exhibits while they took pictures. Soon after that, I, alongside my staff, was taken to the police Area Command Onitsha and paraded before the public and journalists.
 According to Mr. Mokwe, the police showed no interest in investigating or arresting the lodger who had occupied the room in question immediately before they had coincidentally arrived to search it:  The police have some questions to answer: why did they not make attempt to arrest the person that lodged in the room, despite the fact that guest's [registration] was sent to them? If it was real, the person who stayed in the hotel room should have been apprehended. It would then be for him to reveal who gave him the things [he left in the room], because there is no way he could have slept in that room with all those things without knowing. When the identity of the people that orchestrated my hotel set-up became known even by the general public, a petition was written by my lawyer to the Inspector-General of Police, listing their names. But the police sat on it because arresting them would have meant releasing me and that would have meant a state financial liability and embarrassment for the state government.
 Mr. Mokwe also maintained that he was set up on criminal charges, and his hotel was demolished, at the behest of a corrupt local government and police force:  With the police under pressure from the media, most especially by NIPPRON, I, along with three of my staff, was arraigned in court on the 17th of October 2013 and a murder charge along with possession of human skulls and fire arms were heaped on us and we were subsequently remanded in prison. I spent a total of two months and seventeen days at SARS Awkuzu. My hotel demolition had nothing to do with fighting crime, as it was sold to the general public. When I was bailed, a legal officer with Anambra State government begged my cousin to tell me to lie low until after the elections. I obeyed. So you can see that it’s not all about justice, it's about what they can gain from it. They told me to lie low that after electioneering campaign, something would be done to address the issue, but till date nothing has been done. The state government should sit with my lawyer or appoint someone to sit with my lawyer and agree on how to pay for the damages. You don't beat somebody and tell him not to cry. Secondly, this matter is impossible to wish away. No amount of prayer will wish it away. I must be paid everything. Everything I had was destroyed, including my Green Card, in that hotel building. Those fabricated charges should be cancelled because they are mere damage control charges intended to fill in the blanks, they have no bearing on me because they were manufactured. You don't charge one for possession when you didn’t see anything on him. Also, you don't charge someone for murder when investigation has not been done.    Last updated: 17 May 2015

"Kim LaCapria" 2015-04-20 "The town of Ashley, Kansas, and its entire population disappeared after an earthquake in 1952." "The strange and spooky tale of a town known as Ashley, Kansas (and the fate of its more than 670 residents) after an anomalous incident in 1952 has circulated the Internet for several years. In terms of unexplained events, it's an interesting narrative: a middle-of-the-night earthquake followed weeks of strange happenings; and the town of Ashley — along with everyone who lived there — abruptly disappeared. But if you search for any historical mention of Ashley, Kansas, you'll come up short. No such town is shown on any period maps, nor is it included in any census records. In March 2012, what was likely the first version of the Ashley, Kansas, story was published to a popular creepypasta wiki (i.e., a site for short horror stories that are especially frightening or unnerving) in a version that began as follows: Sometime during the night of August 16, 1952, the small town of Ashley, Kansas ceased to exist. At 3:28am on August 17, 1952, a magnitude 7.9 earthquake was measured by the United States Geological Survey. The earthquake itself was felt throughout the state and most of the midwest. The epicenter was determined to be directly under Ashley, Kansas. When state law enforcement arrived at what should have been the outskirts of the farming community, they found a smoldering, burning fissure in the earth measuring 1,000 yards in length and approximately 500 yards in width. The depth of the fissure was never determined. After twelve days, the state-wide and local search for the missing 679 residents of Ashley, Kansas, was called off by the Kansas State Government at 9:15pm on the night of August 29, 1952. All 679 residents were assumed to be dead. At 2:27am on August 30, 1952, a magnitude 7.5 earthquake was measured by the United States Geological Survey. The epicenter was situated under what used to be the location of Ashley, Kansas. When law enforcement investigated at 5:32am, they reported that the fissure in the Earth had closed. In the eight days leading up to the disappearance of the town and its 679 residents, bizarre and unexplainable events were reported by dozens of residents in Ashley, Kansas and law enforcement from the surrounding area. This story is classic creepypasta: a chillingly fun, but decidedly fictional, tale. In addition to the version cited above, a story titled \"The Disappearance of Ashley, Kansas\" was subsequently posted to Reddit's r/nosleep forum, a site devoted to sharing works of horror fiction. Prior to those Internet mentions in 2012, Ashley existed neither in reality nor imagination. Moreover, only one earthquake was recorded in Kansas in 1952, and that event occurred in April rather than August. An earthquake of magnitude 7.5 to 7.9 hitting Kansas would have become local, if not national, lore (much less a pair of such earthquakes occurring within two weeks of each other at the same site), yet no record of such a geological occurrence exists. And even if, in typical conspiracy theory fashion, the powers that be conspired to conceal whatever purportedly happened in Ashley, proof of the town's existence would remain in other texts, maps, and records antedating 1952." 2015 "Apr" 4 1950

 [Collected via Internet, May 2010] Downtown Dallas job over the weekend. They were trying to pull a hot 13,200 volt copper wire out of a conduit. Note the bolt cutter and the copper wire on the ground. It still stinks out here! How the hell can they not know that this sub-station was super hot? No problem — they won't bother one again!
 
 I've been seeing alot of shit when I search google: people have this shit on their blog and say that it happened in California or Oklahoma... it's bullshit. So everyone who is making up a bunch of bullshit needs to learn to fucking read. It happened in downtown Dallas (that's in Texas for those of you who haven't caught up yet.) All the shit I see in other peoples blogs is ridiculous. That they committed suicide, were on PCP. Really, your that bored? Bored enough to make up shit you have no idea what really happened? The point is to show that you don't have to be high, suicidal, homicidal or crazy to get killed by electricity. It is extremely dangerous.
 
 [Collected via Reddit, February 2012] Yeah, except this happened in South Africa and those guys were probably destitute and desperate. Doesn't make what they're doing right... but I can't condemn them to death as easily as you can.

 Origins: In or around September 2009 a set of photographs (later commonly known as \"Dallas copper thieves\" or \"Dallas copper bandits\") began circulating on the Internet. The images were frequently posted and reposted on Internet forums and social media sites, particularly those devoted to exceptionally gruesome deaths:       
 The photographs remained popular in part due to the overwhelming assumption that the dead men were clearly up to no good (i.e., stealing copper, and presumably interfering with vital electrical systems) when they met their ends. While the nature of the images was both upsetting and graphic, viewers felt uncharacteristically comfortable sharing them because of they were perceived to depict a just outcome: The men died, but they wouldn't have if they weren't stealing copper ... in Dallas, Detroit, Oklahoma, Oahu, Hungary, or South Africa. During American discussions of the photos, commenters predominantly stated that the incident shown had occurred at a \"Dallas sub-station\" and happened \"a few months back,\" though some commenters chimed in to claim the incident as local to them in other states. The photographs appeared in September 2009 on a Hungarian web site, and in that version the dead men were identified as \"Roma youth\" (presumably local to page's creator). That set of photographs was larger than the one circulated in later versions of the rumor and included a sign that provided clues as to the scene's true location:  On 19 October 2009, the photographs were shared to a gruesome death-based forum, but no backstory was provided for them. That iteration dropped some of the original set's photos, among them the sign depicted above. On 21 March 2010, a blogger published the photographs in a post titled \"Dallas Copper Bandits (Extremely Graphic)\". As far as we can tell, the images in question first appeared in September 2009 on a now-defunct and controversial South African blog. Although the initial attribution has been lost with any archived copies of that post, available evidence indicates the pictures were not taken in Dallas (or any other portion of the United States) as is often claimed. However, the identities of the men in the images, details of the circumstances under which they died, and the precise location where the pictures were taken remain a mystery.

"David Mikkelson" 2015-03-31 "Image depicts a toddler who was electrocuted after playing with an electrical cord." "Claim: Image depicts a toddler who was electrocuted after playing with an electrical cord. MOSTLY FALSE Example: [Collected via e-mail, March 2015]  [Graphic image.]
 Origins: It's false. On 26 March 2015, a Facebook user published a disturbing image with the following caption: PLEASE DONT LOOK OVER THIS.. DONT SCROLL WITHOUT TYPING (R.I.P) This hurt My Heart DONT SCROLL WITHOUT TYPING (R.I.P) This hurt My Heart
 The image juxtaposed two photographs, one of a little boy with an electrical cord in his mouth, and one of (presumably the same child) lying dead with severe burns all over his face. The implied backstory closely resembled that of an earlier rumor involving a different gruesome image of what appeared to be a deceased child. In that latter claim, the child's cause of death was also said to be an electric shock caused by the girl's putting one end of a plugged-in phone charger into her mouth. Both image-based rumors involved disturbingly graphic images that horrified many viewers who were exposed to them; but as with the previous phone charger rumor, one aspect of the current item is easily disproved and another is so far unexplained. The current version depicts a small boy happily playing with a plugged-in power cord, juxtaposed with a photograph of a dead, burned child who clearly resembles him. Many commenters found it unlikely that the toddler was photographed just moments before his death, fiddling with the cord that later killed him. The image of the child with a cord in his mouth is a repurposed stock photograph that appeared on the Internet as early as March 2008. That photograph has been used numerous times by multiple web sites for a variety of reasons and was obviously not snapped moments before the pictured child died. An <a href=\"https://www.istockphoto.com/photo/safety-baby-cord-chew-ii-3455184\" TARGET=IS>iStockPhoto</a>iStockPhoto description of the image identifies it as part of a series of photographs staged for the illustration of babyproofing-related web content: A 6-month old baby boy chews on an electrical cord. Don't worry the power was off during the shoot. The same child was featured in other photographs for that set of images, perched at the top of a flight of stairs in a similarly precarious position (under the watchful eye of photographers). As for the second photograph in the current item's image pair, it appears to be a screenshot taken from a graphic video of indeterminate origin published to YouTube on 24 August 2012. The video's title is \"3 years old child killed through electric shock in Quaidabad,\" but the video lacks information identifying the circumstances under it was captured and the name or date of death of the decedent. It's certainly possible that the child depicted in the video died in the manner claimed, but the appearance of the boy shown in the video does not seem consistent with that of an electrocution death. A likelier explanation might be postmortem lividity, further evidenced by the presence of insects in the clip. Whenever electricity is in use, a possibility of malfunction and shock always exists to some degree. A young child, toddler, or baby should never be left alone with electrical devices or cords of any description. According to the CDC [PDF], the leading cause of death for infants and toddlers is unintentional injury. Suffocation, motor vehicle accidents, drowning, fires, and ingestion of poisonous substances are listed as the primary forms of death from unintentional injury in babies and toddlers. So while it may be possible for a child to die of electric shock due to a (likelier than not malfunctioning) phone charger, the little boy depicted in the first photo did not die that way. Moreover, cords present a far larger risk of death from suffocation than shock and can pose a threat of strangulation as well as electrocution. No information was available about the manner of death for the child depicted in the second frame, but monsoon-related electrocution remains a likelier explanation than a rare charger malfunction.

"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/inhuman-handprint-2/" "false" "This creepy picture is often used to illustrate a fictional story about a missing college student — complete with fake Snopes rating." "David Mikkelson" 2015-03-29 "Photograph shows an unnaturally large handprint left on the window of a missing college student's dorm room." "This spooky tale first started appearing on the internet in 2012: A photograph allegedly leaked from Erie, PA police department appears to show a disproportionately large handprint on a missing student's dorm room window. 19 year old Elizabeth Hetzler disappeared from her dorm in Edinboro University of Pennsylvania on the night of February 12th, 2007. Her room was located on the third floor of the building, the door was locked, and there was no ledge outside her window. Her roommate awoke in the morning, having heard nothing unusual overnight and simply assumed that Elizabeth had left to go to class early. The roommate later told investigators that when she noticed the handprint, she screamed and knew immediately that \"everything Elizabeth had been talking about was true. It was real.\" The previous evening, Elizabeth had remarked to her friends that she’d had a strange experience walking back to her dorm from a late night dance rehearsal. As she made her way across campus, she gradually got the uneasy feeling that someone was watching and following her. “She seemed so relieved to be back in her room again,” her roommate said. No trace if Elizabeth has yet been found, and investigators have called it the most baffling missing person case of their careers. Since the above image has been circulating the internet for nearly two years, it is difficult to say for certain if it is genuine, although it matches what students and investigators have described (note its size in relation to the coffee pot in the foreground). Remarked Detective Stephen Broze, \"You'd think our suspect would be pretty easy to spot. He must stick out in a crowd with eleven-inch fingers.\"  The above-related tale about the mysterious 2007 disappearance of Edinboro University student Elizabeth Hetzler and the abnormally large handprint found on her dorm room window appeared on the now-defunct Tumblr page CallMeSlendy, presumably a site devoted to legends about popular internet horror character Slenderman. Early versions of the story included a photograph of the purported handprint, said to have been \"leaked\" from the Erie, Pennsylvania, police department. This tale is not an account of a real crime, but rather a fictional scary account woven around an unusual picture to produce a \"creepypasta\" a neologism given to Internet-generated scary stories submitted to the web site of that name (the sort of supernatural tales not out of place around a campfire or on Reddit's popular NoSleep subreddit, such as the infamous account of a Russian Sleep Experiment). Nothing about this particular ghost story would ordinarily merit much attention from us, except for that along the way someone created a mocked-up graphic that made it appear the tale had been included in our web site's listings (with an \"undetermined\" status) back in 2007: This has been tossed around on Snopes, and it's not yet proved true (but nothing is in the supernatural realm, is it?). Basically, this girl Elizabeth Hetzler disappeared from her dorm at Edinboro University of Pennsylvania on the night of February 12th 2007. Her door was locked, so was her window, and her room was on the third floor ...  For the record, the \"inhuman handprint\" story was never an entry on our site before now (March 2015), so if you once struggled (like many searchers) to locate it here, that's because the page in question never existed in our Fauxtography category's \"Oddities\" category (as the image suggested), or in any other section of this site. Nonetheless, the circulating screenshot is a well-rendered forgery, albeit one likely intended as an immersive element of dynamic storytelling rather than a fake page created to dupe the unsuspecting into believing the tale was literally true." 2015 "Mar" 3 2000

Moreover, the article paradoxically noted that it isn't actually possible to get high by rubbing peppermint lip balm on your eyelids (thereby mostly negating any concern that such a practice was common or worth worrying much about): Dr. Mary Romano at Vanderbilt Children's Hospital says beezin' could lead to health risks like inflammation of the eye, swelling, and other symptoms similar to pink eye. She said it's not only dangerous but pointless since there is no active ingredient in the balm that could actually get someone high. \"Getting high means you create an effect on your brain where dopamine is released, which creates a pleasurable experience feeling,\" Dr. Romano explained. \"That's what happens when you use drugs and that's why they become addictive, so you're absolutely not getting high.\" Mention of Beezin' first appeared on Urban Dictionary in 2010, but a video published to YouTube (some language is explicit) in January 2013 likely advanced the spread of the rumor online:  20 March 2015 - KL <FONT COLOR=\"\" class=\"copyright_text_color_g\"><B>Last updated:</B></FONT> &nbsp; 20 March 2015 <hr class=\"hr-spacer\"> <TABLE> <TR> <TD><IMG SRC=\"/images/template/icon-sources.gif\"></TD> <TD> <H2>Sources:</H2> </TD> </TR> </TABLE><FONT SIZE=-1> <DL> <DT><NOBR> &nbsp; &nbsp; Hathaway, Jay. &nbsp; \"Teens Supposedly Get High by Putting Burt's Bees on Their Eyelids.\"</NOBR></DT> <DD><NOBR> &nbsp; &nbsp; <I>Gawker</I>. &nbsp; 24 April 2014.</NOBR></DD> <DT><NOBR> &nbsp; &nbsp; Ramdass, Nadia. &nbsp; \"Beezin': Popular Lip Balm Being Used by Teens to Get High.\"</NOBR></DT> <DD><NOBR> &nbsp; &nbsp; <I>WRIC [Richmond]<I>. &nbsp; 19 March 2015.</NOBR></DD> </DL></FONT>" 2015 "Mar" 3 2010

"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/ash-fault-and-battery/" "mixture" "A rumor holds that improperly stored or discarded 9-volt batteries can touch off house fires." "David Mikkelson" 2015-01-30 "Improperly stored or discarded 9-volt batteries can touch off house fires." "In early 2014, the infotainment program Inside Edition aired a segment about the dangers purportedly posed by 9-volt batteries, focusing on a house fire reportedly touched off when improperly discarded batteries ignited inside a paper bag and started a fire that substantially damaged a family's home. The clip, embedded above, explained 9-volt batteries are sometimes used to intentionally ignite kindling with relative ease (usually in conjunction with steel wool); but the focus of the segment was the supposed risk posed by 9-volt batteries that have been stored or thrown away and the circumstances under which they might touch off fires. Our newsroom also came across similar examples, including the one below: [Collected via e-mail, January 2014] A new e-mail rumor indicates that 9-volt batteries may cause a fire if short circuited. This seems plausible, except: I short circuited 2 batteries (fully charged), together, (minus to plus and plus to minus, simultaneously) and the batteries demonstrated a temperature rise barely sufficient to detect with the bare finger, let alone cause a fire. Likewise, making a \"loose\" connection to cause a spark is nearly impossible. I suspect this is someone's \"worry\" rather than an actual fact. My question is: Is there enough energy in a 9-volt battery to start a fire? If so, how? Two incidents involving damage to homes due to suspected 9-volt battery fires have been widely reported. In the segment displayed above, a Colorado family's house was said to have caught fire due to 9-volt batteries that jostled inside a paper bag intended to be disposed in the trash. The homeowner, Dave Miller, first shared his tale with Kansas City station KCTV in January 2014 (although the date of the fire was not provided). In July 2012, a New Hampshire family sustained fire damage to their home following the unintentional ignition of 9-volt batteries stored in a junk drawer. The New Hampshire Department of Safety's Fire Division published a warning in August 2012 about 9-volt battery safety in response to the incident, and even before that blaze EHS Safety News America had cautioned: If you are storing loose 9 volt or AA or other batteries in a kitchen drawer or a \"junk\" drawer in your home, watch how you store them. Above all don't store them loose and rolling around with other metal, glues, and more of the lovely mix of things we keep in our junk drawers. All you need to have happen is for a metal object like steel wool or a paper clip short out across the top of a 9 volt battery and ignite paper or other easily ignited materials and you'll have a potential disaster in your home:  I speak to 50-60 people at a time about fire safety in the home on a monthly basis. I get the same reaction from every group when I hold up a 9 volt battery and announce that it is a fire hazard and it could burn down your house. They all kinda look at me funny, as if to ask, \"Did you just say a 9 volt battery could burn down my house?\" That look is almost comical. Q: Where do you store your batteries? A: Throw them in a \"junk\" drawer. I then hold up a brillo pad (just one example). Q: What do you do with the batteries when you are done with them? A: Throw them in the trash. A 9 volt battery is a fire hazard because the positive and negative posts are on top, right next to one another. If this comes in contact with anything metal (aluminum foil, brillo, etc.) it will spark, and if there is a fuel for this spark you will have a fire. (Fire needs heat, fuel and oxygen to burn.) To test this theory, put a 9 volt battery or a couple of AA batteries in your pocket with some loose change or your key chain full of keys. This will bring on a whole new meaning to the words \"hot pants.\" Widespread circulation of videos about fires caused in this manner has created the false impression such fires are common or \"on the rise,\" but that does not appear to be the case. According to the most recent statistics cited by the National Fire Prevention Association (NFPA), 9-volt batteries are not one of the ten most common causes for house fires [PDF]. Cooking, heating, and lighting equipment top the list, with arson, \"smoking materials\", washers and dryers, candles, and \"playing with heat source\" rounding out the rest. Although cooking and kitchen fires generally caused more destruction, smoking was linked to a higher risk of death in the event of a fire. The NFPA advises specific handling and disposal protocols be adhered to when storing or discarding 9-volt batteries in order to minimize the possibility of their igniting and causing fires in rare conditions when they are stored with other batteries or objects composed of metal: Storing 9-volt batteries Disposal" 2015 "Jan" 1 2010

"David Mikkelson" 2014-10-19 "Photograph shows a masked partygoer who killed seven people on Halloween 1962." "The annual celebration of Halloween is typically associated with symbols of murder, mayhem, and madness, but of the playful show variety — celebrants don't generally engage in those behaviors, but rather act them out with costumes and props in the name of good, safe, spooky fun. One online purports to chronicle a gruesome, decidedly non-playful Halloween incident, though — the tale of a black-masked reveler who killed seven people with a kitchen knife at a costume party on Halloween night of 1962 and fled the scene, never to be identified, captured, or brought to justice:  This image, too, is nothing more than a bit of fun, however; a terrorific fictional backstory tacked on to an otherwise ordinary vintage Halloween photograph. No such murders were reported anywhere in the U.S. on Halloween of 1962, and the story has too many logical holes in it to be plausible: If the killer \"locked all the doors [to the room] from the outside,\" how did he get into the room to stab his victims (or get back out of the room afterwards)? If his intent was to slaughter everyone present, why did he stop after killing only seven people? (Clearly he wasn't subdued and captured, since he was reportedly \"never caught.\") How could the FBI definitively know that a mask found seven years later was the very same one worn by the perpetrator of that massacre back in 1962? What this image actually documents is that back in the days before mass-produced, store-bought costumes became the prevalent form of Halloween garb, people donned all sorts of unusual (and often homemade) outfits for the occasion, many of which look disturbingly creepy to modern viewers. This photograph hails from that time and is similar to a number of other vintage Halloween pictures from that era." 2014 "Oct" 10 1960

"David Mikkelson" 2014-10-16 "A vacationing man discovered that increasing pain he was experiencing was due to a tropical spider's living under his skin." "Claim: A vacationing man discovered that increasing pain he was experiencing was due to a tropical spider's living under his skin. PROBABLY FALSE Example: [Collected via Twitter, October 2014]  Origins: On 15 October 2014, social media lit up with a seemingly implausible tale. An Australian man named Dylan Maxwell (Thomas) quickly became the subject of international buzz (via Facebook) after he asserted that during his vacation trip to Bali, a spider burrowed under his skin
and had to be surgically removed. Maxwell's frightening arachnic story was picked up by news outlets in Australia, then Europe, and eventually in the U.S. Images sourced from Thomas' Facebook circulated as well via news outlets on Twitter and Facebook:  Spider burrows through man's appendix scar and crawls under his skin https://t.co/pbNc9kGcjA pic.twitter.com/DVVTvY5NtC — Daily Mail Online (@MailOnline) October 16, 2014  Although Maxwell's tale spread quite widely, nearly all the initial reports of it stemmed from the same source, an article published by the Australian news site NT News: Bunbury local Dylan Thomas' first trip to Bali was complete with a visit to the Bali International Medical Centre to have a tropical spider pulled out of his stomach. 21-year-old Dylan awoke after a quiet night in his four and a half star hotel room to find a bizarre red trail two inches from his naval [sic] and heading upwards. \"It was as if someone had scratched me with the tip of a knife,\" he said. Later that evening, the trail had moved two or three inches higher. When a concerned Dylan fronted up to the doctors, they told him it was a small insect bite, and gave him some antihistamine cream to rub on the red line. Later that morning he awoke to blisters. “That's when it became painful, it was a searing burn,” he said. He finally saw a dermatologist, who told him that it was something out of the ordinary. Doctors extracted a tropical spider that had burrowed itself into the scar from Dylan's recent appendix removal. The doctors put the spider in a container and took it away for testing. Dylan will be informed next week as to what kind of spider made home in his body for three days. 21-year-old Dylan awoke after a quiet night in his four and a half star hotel room to find a bizarre red trail two inches from his naval [sic] and heading upwards. \"It was as if someone had scratched me with the tip of a knife,\" he said.

 Moreover, all the information contained in that article came from Maxwell himself, thus unleashing on the Internet that bane of fact-checkers: the single-source, self-reported, uncorroborated implausible story. And not only was that story reminiscent of several other familiar arachnid-based urban legends that have circulated for more than a century, such as those about spiders living or laying eggs under human skin, but the reporting agency (Australian Northern Territory's NT News) is one akin to America's National Enquirer or Weekly World News: the online version of a tabloid that publishes silly, sensationalized articles such as \"Obama Gets Croc Insurance,\" \"Frog Gets Struck Down by Lightning,\" and \"Best Man Left Bleeding After Being Hit in Eye by Flying Dildo.\" (The story has since been published by more staid news sources as well.) We've found no documented cases of spiders living and burrowing under human skin, or even any information suggesting that such an occurrence is possible. Christopher Buddle, an associate professor at McGill University's Department of Natural Resource Sciences, addressed Thomas' claim in an e-mail, saying the story didn't match with what we know about spider behavior: I think this is extremely suspect, unusual, and likely not possible. Simply put: it is not plausible and I can think of no valid reason why a spider might 'crawl beneath skin through a scar'. The claim that it was 'feeding and moving up through the scar tissue' defies logic and defies what we know about the biology of spiders. I am also sceptical because the 'evidence' (the spider itself) is not presented. As noted, no corroborating information about this alleged medical case has been offered: no pictures of the skin-invading spider have been presented, no doctors involved in treating the patient have been quoted, and no witnesses to the spider removal other than Dylan Maxwell himself have been referenced. Perhaps there's a germ of truth to this story that has been distorted through misdiagnosis or misunderstanding, but in the absence of any other evidence we remain extremely skeptical about the tale as presented.

"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/venomous-asp-caterpillar/" "true" "This deceptively fluffy-looking caterpillar has a painful sting." "David Mikkelson" 2014-09-07 "Photographs show a venomous caterpillar known as an asp." "In 2014, we collected this post from Facebook: This little critter is called an ASP. Believe it's a caterpillar. KILL IF YOU COME ACROSS ONE. THESE ARE PAINFUL WHEN YOU ARE STUNG BY ONE, WILL SEND YOU TO HOSPITAL, CAUSING NERVE PAIN/DAMAGE AND ARE POSSIBLY POISONOUS. THESE ARE BECOMING MORE N MORE SEEN. SO WATCH YOUR LIL ONES SURROUNDINGS!!! JUST THOUGHT I'D SHARE. MAKE SURE YOU DO THE SAME.  The larval form of the Megalopyge opercularis species of moth is found primarily in the southeastern United States (largely in Texas, Louisiana, and Florida) and goes by a number of common names, including the southern flannel moth caterpillar, pussy moth caterpillar, puss caterpillar, tree asp, and the asp caterpillar. The asp (as we'll refer to it here) somewhat resembles a colored ball of cotton and is venomous not in the sense that it bites, but in that it is covered in fur-like spines that contain venom that can cause varying forms of distress to humans who come into contact with them. The peak months of envenomation are July through November, and symptoms of envenomation typically include burning pain, swelling, nausea, and itching. As noted in a 2007 Clinical Toxicology article about asp caterpillar envenomation: Asp caterpillars pose a seasonal health hazard. Intense, throbbing pain develops immediately or within five minutes of contact with the caterpillar. Stings on the arm may also result in pain in the armpit region. Erythematous (blood- colored) spots typically appear at the site of the sting. Other symptoms can include headaches, nausea, vomiting, intense abdominal distress, lymphadenopathy, lymphadenitis, and sometimes shock or respiratory stress. Pain usually subsides within an hour and spots disappear in a day or so; however, with a larger dose of the venom, it is not uncommon for the symptoms to last several days or longer. Often, those envenomated by the asp caterpillar find that health care professionals have never seen nor heard of the creature; the caregivers are left with little to go on, and the victims are left with the distress of an unknown prognosis. Existing literature often involves a single case study, a self-reported envenomation, or a handful of cases. The need for better information about these caterpillars is not purely academic: at times public schools in Texas have been temporarily shut down because of outbreaks of the caterpillar, and more generally the problem of ignorance in the medical community can lead to under-treatment or mistreatment. According to the American Association for Clinical Chemistry (AACC), the asp is \"one of the most toxic caterpillars in North America\": Megalopyge opercularis, commonly known in Texas as an \"asp\" is one of the most toxic caterpillars in North America. Also known as puss moth caterpillars, the larva are teardrop shaped from 1 to 1.5 inches long. Although called a stinging caterpillar, the venom is actually in spines connected to a poison sac and concealed by the outer hairy surface. When touched they break off and remain in the skin releasing the venom. Intense throbbing pain develops within five minutes of contact with pain extending up the affected arm. Other symptoms may include headaches, nausea, vomiting, intense abdominal distress, lymphadenopathy, lymphadenitis, and sometimes shock or respiratory stress. Erythematous spots or hemorrhagic papules may appear at the site of the sting and last for 1-5 days. Some of the more unusual presentations have been in children where they have gotten into the mouth and deposited spines and venom in the mucus tissues. These spines can persist and one researcher describes the experience of removing shoes after being in an infected area and transferring a spine from the shoe to the eye causing severe pain. The number of exposures peaks in June-July with a second peak in October. One researcher reported that there may be two generations within a year. The poison control centers report that about one fourth to one third of the patients experience intensive pain that radiates up the arm or leg. The pain is severe enough for some patients to believe they are having a heart attack. In a reported case of abdomen “sting” severe abdominal pain ensued with an emergency department visit and work up for acute abdomen. The AACC recommends the following immediate treatment for those who come into contact with asp spines: The use of adhesive tape to remove the spines that remain on the skin is recommended. Wash the area with soap and water to remove any remaining venom. Prompt application of an ice pack and a baking soda poultice should help reduce pain and swelling. Over the counter analgesics appear to be ineffective for reducing pain and headache. Oral administration of antihistamines may help relieve itching and burning following up with topical corticosteroids to reduce intensity of inflammation." 2014 "Sep" 9 2000

"David Mikkelson" 2014-08-19 "A teenager died attempting the ALS 'ice bucket challenge.'" "Claim: A teenager died attempting the ALS 'ice bucket challenge.' FALSE Origins: Chances are you've seen the \"ice bucket challenge\" mentioned on Facebook or Twitter, especially now that celebrities and other notable figures have been participating in the meme. But as new entries are posted, a rumor suggesting ice bucket challenges can be fatal has circulated as well, with a few versions of the tale often accompanying posts about the social media trend. Users have asked about the rumor, and concerns about the safety of the ice bucket challenge have proliferated. Several variations have been suggested as part of the ice bucket death rumor, but most frequently the ill-fated charitable party is said to have fallen victim to a slippery ice bucket or died of shock after being exposed to freezing water. One such claim suggesting the former originates from a \"satirical\" website, alleging that a teenager was killed by a falling ice bucket in an incident captured on video: The \"ice bucket challenge gone wrong/slippery bucket\" version of the rumor got a boost on Twitter when a parody account spread the video without attribution. Many users appear to have mistaken the account for that of the rapper Drake, as both accounts have the same display name:  Ice bucket challenge gone wrong https://t.co/sOccLyDD4G — Drizzy (@Drrake) August 19, 2014  Close examination reveals that the Twitter handle of the parody account is not spelled correctly. An earlier claim involved the second scenario, in a somewhat self-contradicting narrative: in that version a woman named Latasha Brown accepted the ice bucket challenge from a Facebook friend, only to die in under a minute due to a heart attack or hypothermia: However, that information all originated with a spoof article published on Huzlers, a site which is self-described as \"a combination of real shocking news and satire.\" Moreover, the photograph accompanying the Huzlers article did not picture a now-deceased woman named Latasha Brown, but rather a still-alive woman named Sandra Robinson whose photo had been included in a much earlier Natchez Democrat article about ice challenge participants. Similarly, other reports claimed that a 17-year-old Mississippi girl named Nancy Oley died of a broken neck while attempting the challenge when a giant bucket of ice water was accidentally dropped on her head. However, the only documentation presented for this claim was a video clip of unidentified origin that cut off abruptly just as a large plastic bucket dropped onto a girl's head:  In fact, the young woman pictured in this clip was 19-year-old Therese Todd of Silver Spring, Maryland, who \"fell down and had the wind knocked out of her\" as a result of the incident captured in the video but was otherwise okay. News accounts have also reported a boy named Cameron Lancaster as an example of a teenager who died while attempting the challenge. However, the youth was reportedly engaged in \"tombstoning\" (a fad that involves jumping into water from cliffs, piers and other structures) and drowned after plunging into a water-filled quarry; a connection between his death and the standard ice bucket challenge of dumping water over one's head appears to be rather tenuous in this case: Cameron Lancaster, 18, drowned at Prestonhill Quarry near Inverkeithing, Fife. Emergency services rushed to the scene after receiving a report that he had disappeared under the water, but were unable to save his life. Locals say an increasing number of youngsters have been jumping into the water at the popular 'tombstoning' spot because of the ice bucket phenomenon. \"There are rumours and speculation that this tragedy is linked to the ice bucket challenge. \"Some children have been jumping off the cliffs at the quarry. They have always done that, but it seems there has been a recent increase because of this challenge. \"There is no confirmation at this stage, but that is what we think has happened.\"
 It's worth mentioning that while rumors of heart attacks or blunt force trauma due to the ice bucket challenge in its current form (as a fundraising tactic for ALS) specifically cited above may be untrue, some earlier fatal incidents occurred abroad before the practice became a social media trend. At that time, the \"ice bucket challenge\" was a drinking game unlinked to charity donations and referred to as \"neknominate\":      Last updated: 30 August 2014 original page - 19 August 2014

"David Mikkelson" 2014-04-09 "Schoolkids are smoking and injecting crushed bedbugs to get high from a hallucinogenic substance they contain." "April 2014 saw the proliferation of Internet accounts, based on a purported local television news spot from Phoenix station KNXV, reporting the latest alleged shocking schoolyard trend: kids smoking or injecting crushed bedbugs to get a cheap high from a hallucinogenic substance (PH-417) supposedly contained within those critters: Kids smoking BED BUGS to get high, talk about terrifying tween trend! In their latest effort to find a cheap high that doesn't require the purchase of any actual drugs, teens have discovered a way to smoke bed bugs. Yes, BED BUGS. The things that normal people hate even thinking about. The little critters that plague hotels and give guests nasty rashes. Yes, those very same bed bugs. Apparently, the insects contain a hallucinogenic substance within them, except it's impossible to isolate it, so the bugs have to be caught, killed and crushed into a powder, which is then either smoked or, perhaps even worse and more disgusting, injected. How did they even think of this?! Unfortunately, not only is the very idea of this cringe-worthy, but the bugs also contain other elements that can cause serious damage to the mind and body, so smoking them can be extremely dangerous. Like you didn't already know that.  However, this story was just a hoax, an April Fool's Day prank based on an altered version of a real KNXV-TV report from several months earlier on the dangers of \"dabbing\" (i.e., inhaling butane-extracted hash oil, also known as BHO): If you're involved with cannabis at all, whether recreationally, medically, or from a business standpoint, then you either know about or have probably heard of \"dabbing.\" This method of consumption has been around for at least a decade, but the advent of more advanced extraction methods have led to a flood of cannabis concentrates that have boosted dabbing's popularity. Dabs are doses of cannabis concentrates that used to mostly refer to butane hash oil (or BHO), but has grown to include a variety of other concentrates such as wax, shatter, budder, or even \"errl,\" which is a playful meme-derived way of saying oil. These concentrates can be up to 80% THC, the active psychoactive compound in cannabis, but usually range between 50 and 75%. A dab usually refers to a dose of concentrate that is heated on a hot surface, usually a nail, and then inhaled.  Shane Watson, the interview subject featured in both the hoax \"bedbug\" video and the original KNXV news report on \"dabbing,\" posted his own clip to YouTube to explain that he had nothing to do with the former, and that the latter misrepresented his involvement with the issue:  The \"crushed bedbugs\" item has now entered the pantheon of bogus alarmist warnings about fictitiously bizarre things that kids supposedly do to get inexpensive highs, such as shamboiling (i.e., inhaling boiled shampoo fumes), jenkem (i.e., inhaling fermented raw sewage), and shooting up with Pantene brand shampoo." 2014 "Apr" 4 2010

TRUE Example: [Collected via e-mail, March 2014]    Origins: As depicted in the photographs displayed above, on 24 March 2014 a 2-year-old child received minor injuries while playing in an Illinois public playground, with the cause of his injuries determined to be a series of razor blades that someone had maliciously glued to the children's equipment in that playground: Less than a week after the first day of spring began bringing children to Quad-City parks, a 2-year-old boy was injured with a cut on his hand from razor blades that had been glued to playground equipment in an East Moline park. The boy's father treated him at home, and went with police to Millennium Park, where they say they found and removed around a dozen razor blades on the monkey bars, a slide and on the ground, glued onto park equipment with a white, putty-like substance. Police spent several hours searching the city's other 15 parks. Officers discovered another incident of vandalism at a nearby park, but Foltz said he was not sure if the two were related. Foltz said police weren't sure how long the razor blades were there. He also had no information on a possible suspect or suspects.

"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/family-die-spider-tea-kettle/" "false" "Milk, sugar, and poison is not how one typically takes their tea." "Barbara Mikkelson" 2014-03-11 "A family perished after drinking tea from a kettle in which a deadly spider had died." "We began seeing this dire warning about checking the contents of one's tea kettle in August 2013. If you slept with water in the kettle don't use it the next day. Please, ensure u re-rinse your kettle before using it in the morning. A family of 6 was found dead and a research was made that a deadly spider was found inside the kettle of which they drank tea from. Please, help and broadcast to all your contacts. This is serious guys, life can be taken by something so small.  At that time, the type of spider that supposedly caused the deaths of six people was not specified, but later iterations of the hoax included three photos of brown recluse spiders perched on coins (to give viewers a better sense of their size) while the text of the warning identified the displayed arachnids as violin spiders. Violin spiders are native to South Africa and are closely related to the brown recluse spiders of North America. The bite of either is a horrific thing to endure, and searches on the web will quickly turn up a myriad of photos of gruesome injuries resulting from such attacks. However, that the venom of both sorts of spiders can cause nasty injuries when injected into unwitting victims does not mean that either of these arachnids is poisonous. Spiders are venomous, not poisonous, which means for their venom to have a deleterious effect, it has to enter the bloodstream or the lymphatic system of the victim, which would not happen were someone to drink water in which a venomous (even a highly venomous) spider had been stewed to death. Moreover, such a toxin would be exceedingly unlikely to survive with much potency after having been diluted with enough water to brew tea for six people and then boiled thoroughly on top of that." 2014 "Mar" 3 2010

Origins: In the culinary world, a Dutch oven is a thick-walled iron cooking pot with a tight-fitting lid. In the common vernacular, however, a \"Dutch oven\" refers to the crude act of passing gas under the covers in bed and then pulling those covers over the head of the bed's other occupant, trapping him or her in a foul-smelling air pocket. In October 2007, the Ronson Writer web site published an article about a man who had reportedly been convicted of manslaughter after pulling a \"Dutch oven\" on his wife and accidentally suffocating her: Mr Brian Flannery was convicted of 2nd Degree Manslaughter today at Peckham Crown Court, receiving a 5 year suspended sentence for the accidental death of his wife, Gloria Flannery, by toxic suffocation, after he gave her a 'Dutch Oven' that went, as the Judge described it, 'horribly, horribly wrong'. The case for the prosecution argued for the charge of Murder, putting it to the court that, late one weekday evening as Mrs Flannery was reading a Jackie Collins novel in bed and unwinding for sleep, she was suddenly and forcibly pinned under the duvet by Mr Flannery, who sealed the edges with his weight while simultaneously releasing an enormous bolus of flatulence, which displaced all the available oxygen so that Mrs Flannery passed out nearly instantly, and was dead within 30 seconds. The case for the prosecution argued for the charge of Murder, putting it to the court that, late one weekday evening as Mrs Flannery was reading a Jackie Collins novel in bed and unwinding for sleep, she was suddenly and forcibly pinned under the duvet by Mr Flannery, who sealed the edges with his weight while simultaneously releasing an enormous bolus of flatulence, which displaced all the available oxygen so that Mrs Flannery passed out nearly instantly, and was dead within 30 seconds.
 Six years later that article continues to circulate via e-mail and social media, with many who encounter it mistaking it for a genuine news report. However, no such case of \"Dutch oven\" suffocation occurred: the article was simply a humorous spoof from the Ronson Writer, whose content is self-described as \"part satire, part opinion and part vaguely-verified factual reporting, but always (we hope) at least mildly amusing.\"   Last updated: 5 December 2013

They were kept in a sealed environment to carefully monitor their oxygen intake so the gas didn't kill them, since it was toxic in high concentrations. This was before closed circuit cameras so they had only microphones and 5 inch thick glass porthole sized windows into the chamber to monitor them. The chamber was stocked with books, cots to sleep on but no bedding, running water and toilet, and enough dried food to last all five for over a month.

"Barbara Mikkelson" 2013-06-23 "A burglar discovered a suicide in the home he'd broken into." "Claim: A burglar discovered a suicide in the home he'd broken into. TRUE Origins: On 19 June 2013 a would-be burglar in New Zealand made a gruesome discovery in a vacant home. Just after midnight, after entering a lit hallway in the otherwise darkened home, he \"stumbled across the dead body hanging in the dark,\" as the New Zealand Herald put it. Said encounter prompted the young man to run screaming into the night, with neighbors of the deceased hearing him shout \"He's dead, he's dead.\" The affrighted burglar raced to his mother's home a few doors away and from there telephoned police to report the grisly find and turn himself in. Police arrested the man for the break-in burglary but released him later that morning. Hamilton city tactical co-ordinator Senior Sergeant Freda Grace said no charges had been laid. The deceased took his own life and had been dead for no more than a day. This real-life occurrence of a burglar's encountering a suicide while going about his business shares a few similarities with an urban legend that dates to at least 1979. In that far-fetchedyarn, a man's attempt to throw a good scare into his wife by faking his own death by hanging not only has the intended effect upon his spouse, but leads to the demise of the neighbor who came when the wife screamed but stayed to help herself to a few things.

"Barbara Mikkelson" 2013-06-11 "Wet footprints behind the sofa prove that a teen babysitter barely escaped from a knife-wielding intruder." "Claim: Wet footprints behind the sofa prove that a teen babysitter barely escaped from a knife-wielding intruder. LEGEND  Examples:  A 15 year old girl was babysitting her little sister while her parents went out to a party. She sent her sister off to bed around 9:30 while she stayed up to watch her favorite T.V. show. She sat in her recliner with a blanket and watched until it went off at around 10:30, after it went off she turned around in her seat to face the big glass door and watch the snow fall. She sat there for about 5 minutes or so when she noticed a strange man walking toward the glass from outside. She sat there staring as he stared at her back. He started to pull a shiny object out from his coat. Thinking it was a knife she immediately pulled the covers over her head. After about 10 minutes she removed the covers and saw that he was gone. She then called 911 and they rushed over. They examined outside for any footprints in the snow, but there were none to be found. Two cops walked into her house to tell her the bad news and they noticed a trail of big wet footprints leading up to the chair where she was sitting. The cops came to their conclusion and immediately told the girl she was very lucky because the man she saw staring at her was not standing outside, but he was standing behind her and what she saw was his reflection.
 
 [Collected via e-mail, June 2002] there was this young girl 15 or so, anyway one night she was home alone while her parents were working late. in the girls living room was a sliding glass door and the tv was next to it while the couch was opposite the tv about 4 feet or so. the sliding door had no blinds and it was cold dark and windy outside. the girl was watching tv and listening to her walkman at the same time, she was sitting on the couch, during the night she was horrified to see a mans face in the window, he was all scraggly looking and he was holding a meat cleaver, his mouth was etched in a angry look and his eyes were fixed on the girl. she was so scared she grabbed the blanket next to her and covered herself so he couldnt see her then she grabbed the phone and called the police. she left the blanket on and didnt look up until the police came. eventually they knocked on the door and she answered it. she told the two officers what had happened and they searched the house. it had been snowing that day so one officer looked outside the glass door, he was baffled to find no footprints in the snow. one officer searched the living room he looked behind the couch and froze. the officer called the girl and his partner over to where he was. the officer said to the young girl, ms ur extremly lucky, she asked why and he pointed behind the couch, the girl almost fainted by what she saw behind the couch on the carpet was wet footprints and a meat clever. the officer then said \"the man wasn't looking in the window from outside, he was standing behind u and the couch and what u saw in the window was his reflection!!!\"
 
 [Collected via e-mail, November 2000] A girl was home alone at night (of course!) and watching T.V. on a couch by a glass sliding door. It was cold, and at winter time. She glanced into the glass, and saw the hazy figure of a tall man. She grabed the portable phone and dove under a blanket and called 911, hoping the man hadn't seen her. The police finally came, and conducted an investigation. They didn't find any foot prints in the fresh snow, but instead waterey footprints behind the couch. \"You are very lucky to be alive, young lady!\" the policeman said. \"Why?\" replied the confused girl. \"Beacuse the man was behind the couch, that was his reflection you saw in the glass.\"
 Origins: Our oldest sighting of this urban legend about a teenage girl spotting her putative killer's reflection in the glass of a door or window dates to 2000, yet this campfire tale may be older still. This yarn of grisly murder barely averted always takes place on a snowy or rainy night when the teen girl is either on her own or has a younger sibling or two in the house with her. When armed, the would-be attacker is wielding a knife or a meat cleaver, implements sure to produce a gruesome end to anyone they're used on. When she spots the menacing face in the window, the girl attempts to shield herself from the man's gaze by hiding under a blanket. Depending on how the story is told, she either telephones the police while under there or does so after emerging from her protective covering. The true gravity of the imperiled teen's situation is revealed only after police arrive and discover the wet footprints behind where she'd been cowering. The danger she'd hid herself from was closer than it appeared. While this is a tale meant to speed icy fingers down one's spine, it's likely pure fiction. A real knife-wielding attacker probably wouldn't halt in his tracks just because his intended victim pulled a blanket over her head, nor would he just vanish from the house without a sound. (He'd either still be there when the police arrived, or the girl would have heard him moving about as he left.) In all the variations we've so far encountered, only once does the frightened teen do anything to protect herself other than hide under a blanket and call police: in one lone 2005 version, after summoning the gendarmes, she runs upstairs to her room and locks herself in. In common with all \"murdering madmen\" legends, the prey is female and the stalker male. This probably has less to do with out and out sexism than it does with employing a folkloric shorthand to communicate the victim's vulnerability in contrast to the killer's omnipotence. Why the shorthand, the exaggeration of the imbalance? Upon hearing any of these legends, we mentally cast ourselves in the role of the person it happened to. By making the mythical victim appear both especially at risk and not all that capable of protecting herself, we more clearly express our own fears of the world around us and our personal sense of being vulnerable to attack. This legend about wet footprints behind the sofa shares a key theme with some other urban legends, notably The Babysitter and the Man Upstairs, wherein a teenage babysitter eludes a killer hiding upstairs, and The Clown Statue, wherein another teen babysitter barely escapes a killer masquerading as a clown statue in one of the children's rooms. In each of these legends, a teen girl only just avoids being horribly massacred by a stranger lurking in the house. Barbara \"funeral flowers in the attic\" Mikkelson Last updated: 11 June 2013

"David Mikkelson" 2013-04-28 "Mysterious black-eyed children show up at the homes of unsuspecting residents." "\"Black-eyed children\" are mysterious creatures who supposedly resemble kids between the ages of about 6 and 16 — creatures who appear only in the night, when they show up at the doors of unsuspecting residents and ask, in breathless and monotone voices, to use the bathroom, make a phone call, get a ride home, or grab something to eat. Rumors on the Internet of Black Eyed Children showing up at people's houses asking to use their bathrooms.  We saw a video on MSN about \"Spooky Black Eyed Children\" Said they were discovered in the late 1990s. Is this true? Theories about \"black-eyed children\" variously claim them to be vampires, extra-terrestrials, inter-dimensional beings, or some form of demon: In most reports, a small group of kids with all-black eyes approaches an adult who's alone in a car or a house. The kids, usually two boys between the ages of 10 and 13, ask for a ride home or to be let in to the house to use the bathroom or telephone. The adult feels a sense of overwhelming fear before realizing that there's something drastically wrong with the children's eyes. The putative origin of the black-eyed kids legend is a 1998 ghost-related mailing list post by Brian Bethel in which he related an encounter with \"those darned black-eyed kids\" outside a movie theater in Abilene, Texas, then averred that someone else (with whom he had not previously discussed the subject) had reported a similar encounter in Portland, Oregon. Black-eyed children fever hit the Internet in February 2013, when a two-minute video episode of \"Weekly Strange\" featuring a look at these strange, putative beings was posted to the entertainment section of the MSN web site. But as The Inquisitr noted, that video and other sources of information about black-eyed children were far from convincing: [The] brief video looks like an amateur hour version of Unsolved Mysteries, which details the phenomenon and name drops a handful of conspiracy/cryptology websites. Google \"black eyed children\" and you're not much better off. The first handful of results belong to The Examiner and Mysterious Universe, and none of them exactly take what we'd call a fully skeptical view of the subject. Further down, there's a laughably bad Journal of the Bizarre post that claims to \"debunk\" the black eyed children phenomenon with pseudo-biological and pragmatic arguments that sometimes seem about as far-fetched as there being black eyed children in the first place. My conclusion? File black eyed children under the same heading as \"bigfoot.\" Believe it if you like, but realize that there is no evidence of their existence, just subjective testimony that ranges from reasonable to suspiciously fame-whoring. The real mystery, in my opinion, is why this topic made MSN's front page where it started to trend, fooling people into thinking that it's real news. Not surprisingly, the appearance of the black-eyed children video on MSN coincided with the release of Black Eyed Kids, an urban legend-based horror film: Vancouver director Nick Hagen's horror series \"Haunted Sunshine Girl\" continues to be a hit on YouTube, with more than 10 million video views and 20,000 subscribers. The movie \"Black Eyed Kids,\" a spinoff of that series, has been in the works for about a year. It takes the characters from \"Sunshine\" on an adventure, as they investigate the origins of the occult legend of the black-eyed kids. The story in the film is fictional, but reports of black-eyed kids sightings, especially in and around Portland, are very real, Hagen said. \"Black-eyed kids is an urban legend that's been floating around on the Internet for years now,\" Hagen said. \"I always thought it was fascinating.\" It's been a fun legend to play with, said Mercedes Rose, who co-produced the film with Hagen. \"We're the first (film group) to do anything with this black-eyed kids legend,\" said Rose, who also acts in the production. \"We're super-excited for people to see it. It's so creepy.\" In the film, Sunshine, played by a teen actress who asked that her name be withheld to protect from online stalkers, has a friend contact her after somebody he knows vanishes. Suspecting that the black-eyed kids myth has something to do with it, Sunshine and others go to Portland to look for video proof. \"They find (a black-eyed kid), but they discover something a lot more evil than they imagined,\" Hagen said. \"And they try to get out alive.\"" 2013 "Apr" 4 1990

"David Mikkelson" 2013-01-24 "An \"expressionless\" apparition in a blood-covered gown appeared at Cedars-Sinai hospital in 1972." "This item about an \"expressionless\" apparition in a blood-covered gown who supposedly appeared at Cedars-Sinai hospital in 1972 isn't an historical account of an event witnessed by others and passed down over the span of forty years. It's merely a bit of supernatural fiction that gained widespread currency on the Internet after appearing on Creepypasta (a site for \"short stories designed to unnerve and shock the reader\") in June 2012. In June of 1972, a woman appeared in Cedar Senai [sic] hospital in nothing but a white, blood-covered gown. Now this, in itself, should not be too surprising as people often have accidents nearby and come to the nearest hospital for medical attention, but there were two things that caused people who saw her to vomit and flee in terror. The first being that she wasn't exactly human. she resembled something close to a mannequin, but had the dexterity and fluidity of a normal human being. Her face, was as flawless as a mannequins, devoid of eyebrows and smeared in make-up. There was a kitten clamped in her jaws so unnaturally tight that no teeth could be seen, and the blood was still squirting out over her gown and onto the floor. She then pulled it out of her mouth, tossed it aside and collapsed. From the moment she stepped through the entrance to when she was taken to a hospital room and cleaned up before being prepped for sedation, she was completely calm, expressionless and motionless. The doctors thought it best to restrain her until the authorities could arrive and she did not protest. They were unable to get any kind of response from her and most staff members felt too uncomfortable to look directly at her for more than a few seconds. But the second the staff tried to sedate her, she fought back with extreme force. Two members of staff had to hold her down as her body rose up on the bed with that same, blank expression. She turned her emotionless eyes towards the male doctor and did something unusual. She smiled. As she did, the female doctor screamed and let go out of shock. In the woman's mouth were not human teeth, but long, sharp spikes. Too long for her mouth to close fully without causing any damage ... The male doctor stared back at her for a moment before asking \"What in the hell are you?\" She cracked her neck down to her shoulder to observe him, still smiling. There was a long pause, the security had been alerted and could be heard coming down the hallway. As he heard them approach, she darted forward, sinking her teeth into the front of his throat, ripping out his jugular and letting him fall to the floor, gasping for air as he choked on his own blood. She stood up and leaned over him, her face coming dangerously close to his as the life faded from his eyes. She leaned closer and whispered in his ear. \"I...am....God....\" The doctor's eyes filled with fear as he watched her calmly walk away to greet the security men. His last ever sight would be watching her feast on them one by one. The female doctor who survived the incident named her \"The Expressionless\". There was never a sighting of her again." 2013 "Jan" 1 1970

"Barbara Mikkelson" 2012-03-06 "A razor blade discovered in a child's \"footies\" (footed pajamas) injured a baby." "Claim: A razor blade discovered in a child's \"footies\" (footed pajamas) injured a baby. TRUE Example: [Collected via e-mail, March 2012]   Origins: While fanciful stories of danger lurking in consumer goods have long been with us (such as the urban legend about a woman fatally bitten by a venomous snake found lurking in the pocket of her new winter coat), it does indeed happen every now and then that something untoward slips through the quality check process inherent to most manufactured goods, reaches the end consumer, and causes harm. Such was the case in February 2012 of a razor discovered in a child's footed pajamas (sleeper). On 17 February 2012, 10-month-old Trinity Morgan of Beckley, West Virginia, was injured by a razor blade hidden in a new sleeper purchased from a local Walmart two days earlier. The little girl received several minor cuts and one deep puncture wound to her left foot from contact with the cutting implement but didn't require any stitches. Her wounds were treated with antibiotics and bandaged at a nearby emergency room. Said Brittany Morgan, Trinity's mother, in a 21 February 2012 statement posted to BabyCenter.com: Hello I am Trinity's mother and wanted to let you know the story of how this happened. Trinity had an accident and at the time I was washing pretty much every thing she owned and the new sleeper I bought was just laying on her rocker chair beside me so I decide to just slip it on. No she never cryed or acted like anything was up. A little while later she got a little fussy and I went to change her. When I pulled her foot out she started crying and that is when I noticed the razor it came out when I pulled her leg out. I instantly panicied and started to check her legs and foot and that is when I noticed the little cuts and the one pretty good one on the side of her foot. They had all just happened I didn't know there was something like that in there or could even be possible. I would lay down my life for my daughter I love her more than anything in this world and I have cryed and blamed myself enough over this. I would never do anything to hurt this baby! I have not took any legal action and I place no blaim anywhere but if there is some sicko out there... I am just trying to let parents know that dangers like this are out there and can happened. Also My daughter is 10 months old and pushes her own legs in to her sleepers with no trouble at all. Also the ER doctor said even if I would have washed it, chances are in would not have fallin out or worse got caught in some other type of clothing or blanket and caused a much worse cut to her. I am praying that all mothers read this and become aware to check all clothes and blankets and SLEEPERS!!!! Thanks. How the blade came to reside in a child's footies remains a mystery. According to Walmart spokesperson Dianna Gee, the company's stockers do not use the type of blade found in the child's footed pajamas. The store has contacted the manufacturer and Walmart personnel have inspected all clothing in the baby apparel section, finding nothing that would cause concern. The sleeper (which was made in Cambodia) was manufactured by Carter's under its \"Child of Mine\" label. In a statement to The Charleston Gazette, Carter's said: \"The safety and quality of our products have been the hallmark of Carter's and its brands since 1865. As such, the company takes great care to ensure product safety for our customers. This includes rigorous testing and inspection of all products. We are saddened to hear when any child is harmed. This matter has been reported to the proper local authorities and is currently being investigated.\" Carter's both apologized to the family and offered to pay for the emergency room visit. Whether the blade was placed in a child's sleeper deliberately (either in a serious attempt to injure or merely as an ill-judged prank) or was simply one used in the manufacturing plant that by accident found its way into a clothing item produced there is not yet known. The Morgans say they do not plan to pursue any legal action, but they want to make sure consumers thoroughly check any garment before putting it on.

"Barbara Mikkelson" 2010-11-04 "Weave made from dead person's hair causes worms to grow in recipient's scalp." "Claim: Weave made from dead person's hair causes worms to grow in recipient's scalp. FALSE Example: [Collected via e-mail, September 2010]  She looked good in her new hair style! Two weeks later she started suffering severe headaches that would not go away with compral. Frequently she'd wake up at night with the constant headache. She went to a private doctor who gave her myprodols that would work for only a few hours and then the headaches will be back worse than before. Desperate she went to see a specialist who did blood tests and even a scan of the brain and all the tests were normal. Because of the headaches she could not concentrate at work and was sleeping very poorly. she went back to her doctor who decided to examine her scalp and under the beautiful weave he found worms! The worms were burrowing into her skull and after sending the samples to the lab they found that the hair had eggs from which the worms had hatched! The doctor told her that the hair was probably from a corpse because the kind of worms are usually found on dead bodies! The hairdresser who supplied the hair was shocked and told her that they fitted 10 weaves already and that batch of hair had gone very fast! If you have a weave and getting constant headaches, this is something you may consider checking out. Poor krystal had to shave her head after this ordeal and take antibiotics for a full 2 weeks! Lesson: ladies we should be careful with what we put on our heads, it is better to appreciate our natural beauty and be content with what God has blessed us with than to chase artificial beauty. If you know a sister you care about who may benefit from this message, pls. spread it.
 Origins: This sorrowful (but fictional) tale about a hair weave that led to its wearer's scalp being attacked by worms began circulating on the Internet in early September 2010. We've so far picked up four versions, the most recent an October 2013 retelling of the legend that was published in a Kenyan newspaper, picked up and run as a straight news report by a Nigerian Independent Reporters TV Media site, then published as fact by the UK's Daily Mail. Each version changes the name of the woman said to have received the contaminated weave, the city she works in, and/or the location of the hair salon, but otherwise leaves the text of the tale largely untouched:  My friend Laimi, is a PA working in a Laywer's office in Windhoek. Two months ago she went to an upmarket hair salon on Independence avenue and spent well over $1500 for a Brazilian weave.
 
 My friend Irene, is a PA working in a Lawyer's office in Westlands. Two months ago she went to an upmarket hair salon on Kenyatta avenue and spent well over 1500 for a weave.
 
 Irene Myangoh, a personal assistant working at a law firm in Nairobi went to an upmarket hair salon along Kenyatta Avenue, and spent more than N5,500 on a human hair weave.
 (Myprodols is a painkiller vended in Africa which is used to treat mild to moderate pain. Compral is an over-the-counter painkiller comparable to aspirin.) All four versions place the incident in Africa: Windhoek is the capital of Namibia, a country in southwestern Africa; Nairobi is the capital and largest city of the east African country of Kenya; and Westlands (which does indeed have a Kenyatta Avenue) is an affluent neighbourhood in the city of Nairobi. A Brazilian weave (which is not to be confused with a Brazilian blowout, a treatment performed in a salon whereby the customer's own hair is chemically de-frizzed) is constructed of hair extensions made from human hair. The customer's own tresses are first worked into cornrows, which then serve as the platform onto which the extensions are sewn. The resulting \"weave\" sits atop the recipient's own hair, somewhat akin to a wig that's been sewn into place. The procedure takes between four and five hours to complete, and prices in the $1,000 to $2,000 range are not unheard of. The tale of the contaminated hair weave is long on gruesomeness and variable details but short on checkable facts. While the victim's first name is always provided (depending on the version one receives, she's Krystal, Laimi, or Irene), her surname rarely is. Likewise, while the account always says she's a personal assistant at a lawyer's office, the name of the lawyer or firm that employs her is not given. The salon where the manky hair was installed is described only as an \"upmarket hair salon\" on a street that's either Independence or Kenyatta, which is in a city that's either in Namibia or Kenya, two countries the entire width of Africa apart. The results described are also impossible. Popular belief to the contrary, human corpses are not riddled with worms. Rather, once people die, their bodies very quickly attract the attention of a number of species of flies, which (among other activities) lay their eggs on the deceased. The \"worms\" one sometimes sees on corpses are actually maggots, the just-hatched offspring of such flies. Human hair intended for weaves, hair pieces, or wigs is carefully washed, sorted, and matched with tresses of similar color and texture very early in the process of turning it into a fashion accessory. Ergo, even if the hair used had been taken from a corpse and had through that association become infested with fly eggs, those future larvae (\"worms\") would have been washed away by the first cleaning given those strands during the sorting process. The hair weave tale combines three urban legends into one. From the \"poisoned dress\" legend, it draws the element of an item taken from a corpse (a dress in one story, hair in the other) transmitting some manner of horribleness (formaldehyde or worms) to the next wearer. From the \"necrophiliac lover\" legend comes the plot device of a doctor's running tests on the maggots, thereby discovering that the hair used in the weave had come from a dead person. Tying it all together is the \"fatal hairdo\" legend, wherein a gal's unwashed bouffant hair style becomes the home for venomous spiders that serve to punish both her vanity and lack of attention to matters of personal hygiene. There are numerous meanings to the hair weave tale, two of which are contained in its closing: \"Lesson: ladies we should be careful with what we put on our heads, it is better to appreciate our natural beauty and be content with what God has blessed us with than to chase artificial beauty.\" First, the story is one of caveat emptor, a \"buyer beware\" tale wherein a woman comes by her headful of maggots via opting for the latest, greatest hair treatment. In that light, it's meant to impress upon us, its audience, that we never truly know what goes into consumer products and thus should exercise care in our choices. Second, the story is one that decries vanity, in this instance by portraying a gal who disregards the \"better to be happy with what we have\" dictum in favor of an enormously expensive beauty adjunct as paying for her narcissism in gruesome fashion. Vanity is further highlighted as evil by the audience's awareness that if the woman had been able to wash her own hair (which she couldn't, because it was under the weave), those fly eggs would have been long gone well before they had turned into \"worms\" that started chomping on her. Xenophobia also comes into play, as the hair used in Brazilian weaves generally comes from abroad: by portraying the imported tresses as maggot-laden and dangerous, ongoing suspicion about things which come from other countries and cultures is aired. Last, the story reflects our unease with the dead.

"David Mikkelson" 2010-11-03 "A child injured his arm through extended wearing of Silly Bandz." "Claim: A child injured his arm through extended wearing of Silly Bandz. TRUE Example: [Collected via e-mail, August 2010]   Origins: Just as hula hoops, yo-yos, Tamagotchis, and Pokemon cards were the playground fads for their generations, Silly Bandz have become \"must have\" items of the day for today's younger set. These colored silicone stretchy bracelets magically return to their original shapes when taken off the arm, and kids love them not only because they are colorful and fanciful, but at $4.95 per pack of 24, they're cheap to collect and trade. Even college students have joined in on the craze. These pliable bands (which were first sold online in late 2008 and achieved widespread popularity in the fall of 2009) have been banned from some classrooms, camps, and swimming pools. Such injunctions have more to do with the enthusiasm of children for these playthings than out of concern for any danger they might pose: kids wanted to continue comparing and trading bands with their schoolmates even after class began, and they have found it fun to shoot elastics around the room, especially colored and oddly-shaped ones. (Additionally, some school pool facilities have reported problems with the bands' clogging up drains.) However, at times such bans have also made mention of safety issues, such as concerns that some kids were trying to wear Silly Bandz around their necks. In August 2010 a Silly Bandz injury to a preschool child became the topic of a much-circulated e-mail that was often accompanied by a photo of a child's lacerated wrist. On 5 August 2010, 4-year-old Evan Steel of Seneca Falls, New York, presented himself to his dad while in obvious distress. As Jason Steel peeled away layers of Silly Bandz from Evan's wrists, he noticed blood on the child's arm. Evan's wrist, on which he had been wearing 60 or more Silly Bandz for about two days, was swollen and bore several deep cuts. Said the physician who treated him, Dr. Doug Alling, \"His dad found several bottom ones embedded in his son's skin.\" The doctor prescribed an antibiotic, and the child quickly healed. The photo sometimes circulated with the warning quoted above is likely the one taken by Evan's father with his cell phone and sent to Sue Herendeen, a nurse at Alling's office, whom Steel consulted about the child's condition. (Herendeen told him to bring the boy right in.) It is consistent with the injuries reported by the child's family and physician in the Canandaigua Messenger Post, and it was posted by Herendeen to her Facebook page along with the text of the warning. While Silly Bandz are quite stretchy, they are still capable of constricting blood flow if arms are loaded with too many of these circlets and for too long. The formation of blood clots is a potential possible outcome, as is phlebitis, an inflammation of a vein. Patty Davis of the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission advises that \"parents should limit the number of elastic wrist bands that kids wear and they should check their children to make sure they are not too tight.\" Jorge Montalvo of the New York State Consumer Protection Board also advises limiting the number of bands worn by a child, ensuring they are not so tight that they cause pain or constrict movement or blood flow, and making sure the youngster removes the wristwear before sleeping or bathing. While there is always a tendency to demonize the latest trend to sweep the nation's youngsters, it should be kept in mind that preventing a Silly Bandz injury is merely a matter of common sense: Don't let kids wear too many, or for too long. Check for excessive tightness. And make sure kids take them off at night and before swimming or bathing. Last updated: 27 August 2010" 2010 "Nov" 11 2000

"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/soldier-return-family-dead/" "true" "The horrifying homecoming is a long-running legend that might be based on a true tragedy." "Barbara Mikkelson" 2010-09-30 "A soldier returning from deployment discovered his wife had died during his absence, and their children had starved to death." "The harrowing tale of a military father's anguished discovery (as reproduced in the examples above) travels in military circles, where it serves to express one of the greatest fears experienced by those separated from their loved ones by postings to distant lands. The dread of all parents that they might not be present when their children need them most is given voice in this legend about a serviceman's horrifying homecoming from an absence that inadvertently escalated a tragedy and provided a cause for lifelong guilt. In the most common form of legend, a hitherto undiagnosed medical infirmity (heart condition, asthma) or accident is responsible for the wife's passing, while it's the serviceman's absence that proves fatal to the children. Invariably, there are two kids (always described as babies or small children), they die of starvation, and their father is the one to discover their bodies. Although we don't know whether the incident was the basis for commonly circulated form of this legend, it is true that 24-year-old Sgt. Gregory Voelcker of the U.S. Air Force, who was stationed at Britain's Royal Air Force (RAF) Mildenhall base, returned home from a temporary duty assignment in Greece in June 1991 to discover his wife and children dead in their home. Autopsies of the deceased revealed Lorraine Voelcker (27) had died of natural causes, while the couple's two children (two-year-old Galen and 16-month-old Elizabeth) had perished of dehydration, likely ten days after their mother had passed away. No one noticed the absence of Mrs. Voelcker and the children because the family inhabited a remote cottage outside the small village of Kirtling (which itself is 60 miles northeast of London). The Air Force has a \"contact policy\" whereby it keeps in touch with the families of servicemen on duty outside the country, and the squadron had last spoken with Mrs. Voelcker on June 12. During that call, she assured those checking in with her that she and the children were \"absolutely fine\" and mentioned she was planning to take the children on a trip with their grandfather in the north. When the squadron made a routine call a week later, they were not surprised to find there was no reply at the cottage, thinking the family was away. The story contains elements of two venerable urban legends: In the \"Baby high chair death\" tale, parents who've entrusted their child to a sitter while on vacation return home to find their now-dead infant still strapped in his chair where they'd left him because the sitter hadn't shown up and the child starved. In the \"Climax of Horrors\" legend, a man's homecoming is marred by the discovery of the many calamities that have taken place in his absence. As a military legend, the story speaks to the sacrifices those serving their country are called upon to make. Theirs are lives of continual absences from home, often including lengthy periods when they are unable to be in touch with spouses and children. But in a larger sense the legend showcases the fear family members in any line of work have when away from home for extended amounts of time. During their absences, bad things may be taking place, and it is this awareness that fuels a lurking sense of guilt — were they home, they'd be able to safeguard their families from harm." 2010 "Sep" 9 1990

"Barbara Mikkelson" 2010-09-05 "A Berlin restaurant plans to offer meals made from human body parts." "Claim: A Berlin restaurant plans to offer meals made from human body parts. FALSE Example: [Collected via e-mail, August 2010]  \"Berlin 'cannibal' restaurant asks for donors to donate body parts which are then prepared and eaten by the dining party.\"
 Origins: 
In August 2010 news about the impending opening of a restaurant in Germany shocked the sensibilities of many around the world. According to Der Spiegel, a weekly magazine with a circulation in excess of 1 million readers, a restaurant was soon to open in Berlin wherein mankind's strongest taboo, the eating of human flesh, would be violated. Offering \"Wari cuisine\" (the Wari were an Amazonian tribe that practiced ritualistic consumption of the honored dead), Flimé, the proposed eatery, was using its web site to seek donors of body parts as well as advertise for the services of an \"open-minded surgeon.\" A menu listing traditional Brazilian dishes (with the protein component described only as \"meat\") was posted to Flimé's web site, but the location of the planned restaurant was not. Although many news outlets that picked up the story (including Der Spiegel) were skeptical of the putative plans to open a cannibal restaurant of no given location, others repeated the item as if it was verified fact. Which, of course, it was not. After allowing the press chew on the story for a week, on 2 September 2010 the group behind the web site came clean: The cannibal restaurant wasn't real; it existed only in the imagination of the Association of German Vegetarians (VEBU). The web site — its entreaty for body parts and an open-minded surgeon included — had been a publicity stunt intended to showcase the group's belief that all consumption of meat is cannibalism, in that \"Eating animals is like consuming people,\" and \"Every piece of meat is a piece of mankind.\" The group said through the Flimé web site that \"The more severe the reactions to the Flimé have been, the better.\" The stunt had been dreamed up a year previous by the German ad agency Serviceplan, with VEBU's participation. Serviceplan placed fake ads in German newspapers calling for donations of human limbs; set up a website complete with a PDF form through which prospective donors could answer questions about their blood type, body mass index, and health history; and even established an auction on eBay for human liver pâté. (Before eBay twigged to the presence of the auction and shut it down, bids of $1,000 for that \"delicacy\" had been recorded.) VEBU director Sebastian Zoesch stated that he received phone calls and e-mails from people identifying themselves as cannibals, but many of them turned out to be undercover journalists. Taboos against eating one's own are universal, which is why cannibalism is such an attractive topic for hoaxsters, prank artists, or those looking to draw attention to their particular causes or artistic endeavors. In 2001, photos of a Chinese man chowing down on what appeared to be a roast infant accompanied by the claim that such cannibalizations were \"Taiwan's hottest food\" and that \"dead babies or fetuses could be bought at $50 to $70 from hospitals to meet the high demand for grilled and barbecued babies\" rocketed through the Internet. The truth, however, was far less shocking: The people of Taiwan view the eating of people with as much abhorrence as those of anywhere else; and the \"grilled baby\" pictured was likely fabricated from sticking a doll's head onto a roast duck; and the photo had been the work of Chinese artist Zhu Yu, who performed a conceptual piece titled \"Eating People\" at a Shanghai arts festival in 2000.

 [Collected via e-mail, August 2013] A couple lost their 25 year old son in a fire at home on June 4th. The son who had graduated with MBA from the University of Wisconsin-Madison two weeks earlier had come home for a while. He had lunch with his dad at home and decided to go back to clean up his hostel room. His father told him to wait, to meet his mother, before he went back for a few days. He decided to take a nap while waiting for his mom to come back home from work. Some time later their neighbors called 911 when they saw black smoke coming out of the house. Unfortunately, the 25 years old died in the three year old house. It took several days of investigation to find out the cause of the fire. It was determined that the fire was caused by the laptop resting on the bed. When the laptop was on the bed cooling fan did not get the air to cool the computer and that is what caused the fire. He did not even wake up to get out of the bed because he died of breathing in carbon monoxide. The reason I am writing this to all of you is that I have seen many of us using the laptop while in bed. Let us all decide and make it a practice not to do that. The risk is real. Let us make it a rule not to use the laptop on bed with blankets and pillows around. Please educate as many people as you can.

 Origins: On 4 June 2010, 25-year-old Arun Gopalratnam died in a house fire at his parents' home in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin. The young man perished in the basement bedroom where he'd been staying after completing his studies at UW-Madison. A neighbor who spotted smoke issuing from the house that afternoon called the fire department, which arrived within minutes and began battling the blaze. Gopalratnam's body was discovered after the fire had been extinguished. Total damage to the home and its contents was estimated at $250,000. Despite the e-mail's assertion that the blaze had been touched off by use of a laptop in bed, Captain Tod Doebler of the Menomonee Falls Fire Department told us in August 2010 that the fire was still under investigation and no determination as to its cause has yet been made. He later told us in response to a follow-up inquiry that the department had ended its investigation without having been able to determine a conclusive cause for the fire. Captain Doebler confirmed during our phone call with him that the fire began in the bedroom used by the deceased, and that both a cell phone and laptop computer were present in that room. However, that these two items were found in the room where the fire started does not necessarily mean either of these electronic devices caused the fire. House fires can start in many ways, including electrical malfunctions in a home's wiring. No one can reasonably say with certainty that he knows what started the blaze, let alone categorically state the laptop was to blame because its air vents had been blocked. Laptops have occasionally touched off house fires, but in instances where the distinct causes were known, the majority of incidents involved mechanical flaws in the units or their batteries — otherwise-robust laptops do not as a rule start fires even when their air intake vents are blocked. Moreover, nearly all major-manufacturer laptop CPUs now include automatic thermal shutdowns to prevent them from overheating, so the possibility that a properly functioning laptop could ignite a housefire are virtually nil. Therefore, the key factor about the e-mailed caution is that it misleadingly uses the circumstances of the death of Arun Gopalratnam to assert that any laptop (not just ones with faulty batteries or suspect wiring) could cause similar deadly fires if used on surfaces that compromised their air vents, such as beds or pillows. While it is generally not a good idea to leave unattended powered-up laptops (or indeed most any other electronic devices) perched upon pillows or mattresses or surrounded by easily combustible materials (such as comforters and blankets), or to fall asleep while using portable computers in bed, most of the inherent danger comes from the risk of one's personal computer being one of those rare units that has a bad battery or has been wired improperly.

"Barbara Mikkelson" 2010-03-22 "Cockroach eggs in drinking straws pose a general danger to restaurant patrons." "Claim: Cockroach eggs in drinking straws pose a general danger to restaurant patrons. FALSE Example: [Collected via e-mail, March 2010]  I ordered a Club Sandwich and a Sprite in a restaurant somewhere. When I finished half of the sandwich I sipped a sprite... But it didn't taste like an ordinary sprite I used to drink. So I sipped once more, but it still tasted the same. It tasted like a sprite mixed with some kind of oil. I called the clerk and asked him if the sprite was expired. He said it was just delivered today.. So I asked him to taste it. Then he also found that something was wrong with it. Both of us were wondering for a while. Then I got to look inside the straw. There were a lot of tiny black round things that looked like eggs. So I cut the middle of the straw lengthwise to have a better look. Yuck. There were a lot of tiny black round things in it.. I suppose they were eggs of cockroach. About 1000 eggs were there. Then I began to check all the other straws in the straws case one by one. Almost all of them contained black eggs that seemed to be either the cockroach eggs or excretions. After the incident I began to check all the straws in the restaurants and fast food chains that I had gone to. Almost of all the straws contained the same black eggs. Especially the darker the colors of straws, the more black eggs were found. In black straws, extreme amount of black eggs were found. It was found out that it's because the cockroaches live (hatch eggs and excrete) in the dark places. * 80% or more restaurants in the malls use red or black colored straws. SO NEXT TIME.... BE CAUTIOUS... CHECK THE STRAW BEFORE YOU PLACE IT INSIDE THE DRINKS.

 Origins: People hate cockroaches not only for their six-legged, antenna-waving creepy looks, but for the health risks they bring into their lives. These creatures are strongly associated with garbage and filth, they can cause serious health problems including three types of salmonella and gastroenteritis, and  they have been linked to asthma. The e-mail in question plays upon our revulsion for this insect even as it raises the common contemporary lore theme of anxiety about the safeness of the foods we eat when out and about. Could these dread carriers of disease be laying their eggs in the very straws we unthinkingly drink from? Our earliest sighting of this item dates to March 2008. In that incarnation, the author (identified as 'Hannie') claimed this \"horrible story of mine goes back to year 2005.\" While the 2010 version has the discoverer of cockroach eggs ordering her club sandwich and Sprite \"in a restaurant somewhere,\" the earlier version of the story took place \"in a restaurant somewhere in Manila, Philippines.\" The earlier version also contained a list of research results said to have been gathered by Hannie in her quest to determine how widespread the \"cockroach eggs in drinking straws\" phenomena was. Two of the eateries named (Jollibee and Chowking) are fast-food chains based in the Philippines, a detail which works to support the claim that this tale was really about cleanliness conditions in that country: Jollibee - RED straws - 88.89% Chowking - RED straws - Almost the same as above Local Restaurants - BLACK straws - 225% above McDonalds - WHITE straws - 0.5% Starbucks - Straws covered with white wrappers - 0% * 80% or more restaurants in the malls use red or black colored straws * 80% or more restaurants in the malls use red or black colored straws
 There are numerous things wrong with this story. First, one has to wonder about someone whose \"horrible story of mine goes back to year 2005\" yet didn't get around to posting about it until 2008. Meanwhile, since 2008 (or 2005, if you believe the backdating), no one else has reported on happening upon the contamination Hannie claims to have found at Jollibee, Chowking, McDonald's, and other restaurants local to her in the Philippines. Second, while cockroaches do secrete themselves in unlit areas, the habitats they seek out also have to be warm and provide ready access to food and water. Their preferred spots in a home are kitchen cabinets, around the water heater, behind the stove, and under sinks. While a dark-hued drinking straw might provide the shelter from light they seek, such a housing wouldn't be warm or necessarily just a short trot from food and water. Cockroaches also avoid highly trafficked areas, so a box of drinking straws (which is constantly being jostled and picked through) wouldn't be these critters' idea of a fine place to raise a family. Third, there's the matter of the eggs. Expectant roaches carry their eggs in a largish brown sac called an ootheca, a firm-walled egg case attached to Mama Roach's posterior which is about the size of dried bean. If the mom-to-be is a German cockroach, she carries it around until its contents hatch, but if she's an American cockroach, she ports it about for a day or two until it hardens and darkens and then hides it in a crevice covered with camouflage she glues in place with saliva. The roach eggs themselves are never out in the open; for the full time unborn roaches are eggs, they're in an ootheca. This means when it comes to roach eggs, one would never truly see \"tiny black round things that looked like [cockroach] eggs,\" in drinking straws or elsewhere. It's safe to mark this tale as \"false.\" While the writer of the piece might have encountered dark flecks of something in a drinking straw (and we're doubtful even of that), those dark flecks wouldn't have been cockroach eggs. Insect excretions are a possibility, but again, one must wonder why no one else has reported similar alarming finds. It's still good advice, however, to make it a point to examine utensils, plates, and take-away food containers provided for your use when dining outside the home. Said examination needn't be overly scrupulous or amount to anything more than a quick visual once-over, but since every now and then you will be presented with a dirty fork or a none-too-clean dish, it only makes sense to fall into this habit. Interestingly (if you're of a somewhat perverse bent, that is), while washing roach eggs down along with your drink is a yucky thought to have to contemplate, there's little reason to suppose that ingesting such items would cause harm. While adult roaches are indeed linked with various diseases, their eggs are not and thus should not generally be unsafe to swallow. (As for the possibility of their hatching inside you, your stomach acids would make short work of any such possibility.) Barbara \"eggs — over easy\" Mikkelson Last updated: 22 March 2010

"David Mikkelson" 2010-01-12 "Photographs show a golfer whose arm was torn off by an alligator." "We got this gruesome email in January 2010: What is a Golf Ball Worth? That's gonna leave a mark. Ouch!!!!!! From Berkeley County South Carolina ... Don't go fishing for your golf ball ...       The above-displayed photographs have been linked to an October 2009 incident in which a 10-foot alligator bit off the arm of a 77-year-old South Carolina golfer as the latter leaned over to retrieve his ball at a pond on the Ocean Creek Golf Course: One of the alligators on Fripp's Ocean Creek Course — a 10-foot, 400-pounder — turned aggressive when a 77-year-old man, the father of a Fripp Island property owner, knelt to pick up his ball and was attacked by the animal. The alligator clamped down on the man's arm and dragged him into a nearby pond. The man lost the arm below the elbow in the struggle. Wildlife officials worked quickly to capture and kill the alligator, before cutting the reptile open to remove the arm from its digestive tract. The victim and his arm were flown to the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston, where doctors tried to re-attach the limb. However, although the photographs shown here are real, they have no connection to that incident. These pictures were actually taken a couple of years earlier and were published in conjunction with a September 2007 news story about Bill Hedden, a 59-year-old snorkeler who lost his arm to a 12-foot gator at Lake Moultrie in South Carolina: They were feasting on roast pork and dancing the Macarena while picnicking at Lake Moultrie on Sunday afternoon when a man in snorkel gear stumbled through the tree line, grasping at his left shoulder where his arm used to be. Blood gushed from between his fingers. 'Call my wife, call my wife,' the man said through a snorkel mask. Five nurses who were among those at the gathering quickly laid the man on the ground. They put ice on his wound, instructed him to take deep breaths and told him stories to keep him awake. One of the picknickers, Jerome Bien, traced the bloody trail through the tree line and to the shore where he saw a pool of blood in the sand. About 25 feet out in the water in front of him, the eyes of a giant alligator stared back. The victim's arm remained clenched in its jaws. Officers from the state's Department of Natural Resources shot the 550-pound reptile, cut it open, and removed Hedden's arm from its stomach, then placed the limb in a picnic cooler and rushed it to the hospital with a police escort. Doctors decided against attempting to reattach the arm, however." 2010 "Jan" 1 2000

"Barbara Mikkelson" 2009-05-02 "Hitchhiker utters prophecy about Judgment Day being upon us, then vanishes." "The most common form taken by the \"Vanishing Hitchhiker\" legend involves a driver who stops to pick up a strange girl on a highway, then during the course of the ride realizes his guest has disappeared. Upon arriving at the address she had mentioned, the driver learns from her relatives that the woman who'd ridden with him has been dead for years. However, that legend also exists in a secondary version which similarly features a hitchhiker who dematerializes from a moving car, but only after solemnly intoning a prophecy. Good crops, the end of a war, a natural catastrophe about to strike, or the imminent coming of Jesus have been predicted by these vanishing prophets. Common to many of these tales is the completing element of the baffled and somewhat unsettled driver's reporting the incident to police or other authorities, only to be told he's the fourth or fifth person that week to have announced having had such an encounter. That element is a plot device necessary to the believability of the story: Without the confirmation from an authority figure that others have shared the same experience, those being regaled with the yarn could quietly conclude the person who heard the prophecy and witnessed its deliverer vanish from the car was off his rocker. A lady was driving and saw a young man walking beside the road. Never before had she picked up a stranger, but she felt that she was to pick up this man so she did. He had a hood over his face and she was not able to see his face at all. She began driving and said to him \"Son, where are you going?\" He said to her \"My lips are near the trumpet.\" She turned to look at him but he was gone! Startled, she pulled over to the side of the road. As she sat there, a police officer stopped to see why she was parked by the side of the road, telling her that it was too dangerous for her to be there. \"I'm so shook up I can't drive\" she told him. \"Why, what\"s wrong?\" he asked. She said \"If I told you, you wouldn't believe me!\" He asked again what had happened and she told him. The officer said to her \"You are the fifth person that has told me this!\" 
 A man driving along a busy motorway sees a hitchhiker and stops. The hitchhiker gets in and straightaway announces the End of the World. The way he speaks makes a deep impression, but when he says he is an angel, the driver looks round at him incredulously, and at that very moment there is no one there; he has dissolved into thin air. The driver's surprise is immense. He stops the car, looks around him, and sees a police car approach. \"You are by no means the first to tell me this story,\" says the officer when the driver tells him his tale. While in the spring of 2009 we noted an uptick in the number of reportings of the heavenly messenger version of the \"Vanishing Hitchhiker\" legend, the narrative itself is as old as the hills. Modern tellings of the tale have the incident happening \"in Lexington (Kentucky)\" or \"near Warsaw, Indiana\" or \"a week or so ago,\" but other versions of this yarn have been kicking around since the 1940s, and precursors to it appear in the Bible. Vanishing prophets who predict catastrophes or speak of the coming of Christ or the end of the world are often said to look like Jesus, or indeed to have straight-out said they were Jesus. (The latter is a popular element in versions collected in the spring of 1971 and winter of 1972, periods coinciding with religious revival on American campuses.) Alternatively, they are also often said to have done something indicating they were angels (e.g., saying \"My lips are near the trumpet,\" a statement meant to identify its speaker as the archangel Gabriel). This form of the legend often surfaces in the wake of a natural disaster, with the encounter said to have happened maybe all of a week before things went to hell in a handbasket. The vanishing prophet set of stories contains a smaller subset in which the prediction of one future event is bolstered by the prediction of a second, equally unbelievable event which subsequently comes true: [Jacobson, 1948] In the wake of the anxiety rumors that swept the nation immediately after Pearl Harbor came a pipe-dream rumor which was undoubtedly the most popular of all: the weird tale of the man who picked up a strange woman in his car. Arriving at her destination, his passenger allegedly offered to pay the man for the gas he had used. But the man refused to accept the money, so the woman offered to tell his fortune. And, as the rumor went, mysteriously she told him, \"There will be a dead body in your car before you get home, and Hitler will be dead in six months.\" Supposedly, then, on the way home the man had seen a serious automobile wreck and had taken one of the victims into his car to rush him to the hospital. But the injured person died en route, which left the hopeful implication that Hitler would therefore be dead within the following six months. Although this pipe dream sounds foolish, it nevertheless spread throughout the country rapidly. It appeared in widely circulated gossip columns, and a lot of Americans took it seriously. Yet this same rumor, in the setting of the period, to be sure, had appeared in every military conflict since the Napoleonic Wars. And it has been said that the rumor probably goes back into the Middle Ages. Simpler forms of the legend omit the \"man dies in the car, thereby making one outlandish prediction come true and consequently adding credibility to the second, as yet unrealized, foretelling\" and skip straight to the prophecy the heavenly messenger has been sent to deliver: [Brunvand, 1981, collected in 1972] My friend John Hogan who I went to DeSalles High with told me this. He goes to St. John Fisher College now. His fiancee and her aunt who's a nun, were going down the Thruway and they picked this hitchhiker up at the entrance. They were coming from Syracuse and going to Rochester. The guy wanted to know if they had ever heard the gospel and if they knew Jesus. Then he'd go, \"He's coming soon\" and then next thing they knew he was gone. They stopped at the nearest service area, pulled up to the gas station attendant and rolled down the window to report it. They were pretty shook up and felt kind of dumb. The guy said he wasn't surprised and would they believe that about twenty other people had reported the same story. 
 [Brunvand, 1981, collected in 1978] Someone Miss Packard knew, unfortunately, I cannot remember the person's name, was driving on a deserted road towards Holbrook on a cold, rainy night. As she was driving, she saw a figure on the side of the road, soaking wet trying to thumb a ride. She felt sorry for the person, stopped the car, and a young man sat down in the front seat. After a long period of silence he said, \"Jesus is coming again.\" She turned to look at him, and he was gone. While \"Jesus is coming\" or \"The end of the world is near\" messages are the most common ones imparted in prevalent recountings of this tale, at other times in history tidings of a different sort have been the legend's focus — such as conclusion of a war the nation is currently embroiled in, the death of a national enemy, assurances about the harvest, or even pronouncements of pestilence to come. [de Vos, 1996, collected in 1984] In February 1602 an unnamed vicar and two farmers were traveling back from the Candlemas fair in Vastergotland (at this time of year the vehicle they used must have been a sleigh). On the road to Vadstena they were accosted by a \"nice\" and \"lovely\" female dressed like a serving-girl who asked for (and was given) a ride. At a wayside halting-station they all alighted to get some food; the girl, however, only wanted something to drink. A jug of beer was procured for her. The vicar observed she did not take it up and found it was filled with malt. A second jug mysteriously changed from beer to acorns and a third — apparently under the vicar's nose — to blood. At this point the serving-girl announced (as if interpreting these omens): \"There will be good crops this year. There will be enough fruits on the trees. There will also be many wars and plague.\" With which she vanished. 
 [Collected via e-mail, September 2012] The story is going around that a woman was driving on the interstate and she saw a man walking. She felt very impressed to stop and pick him up and resisted the ideal. She had never done anything like that before. Then she felt like she had to stop and pick him up and she did. He got into the car and said \"Everyone does not need to be concern about who is going to be the President, because there is going to be a great disaster happening before the election.He just dissappeared and she was so shock she could not even move to drive away. A deputy stopped to see if she was okay and she told him what happened and he stated that she was the fourth person that had told him the same thing happened to them. As to how old these sorts of stories are, says folklorist Gail de Vos about the antecedents to the \"heavenly messenger vanishing hitchhiker\" legend: The story of the deity or heavenly messenger who travels in the guise of a human being is as old as mythology. The Olympians of Greece were fond of traveling incognito; angels appeared to Lot, who took them to be men (Genesis 19: 1-16); and Jesus appeared to two of his disciples on the road to Emmaus and was not recognized by them (Luke 24: 13-35). The vanishing hitchhiker legend in the New Testament Acts 8: 26-39) is strikingly similar to the contemporary version: Philip is picked up by an Ethiopian who is driving a chariot. They discuss religious matters and the Ethiopian asks to be baptized. Philip does as he requests and then vanishes. As to why this legend endures generation after generation and is told in various countries around the globe, difficult times spawn anxieties that as bad as things are, they are about to get worse. Resurgence of tales about heavenly messengers sent to alert the world that the end is near are expressions of the underlying current of dread that makes itself felt during periods of unease or upheaval. Such legends are also confirmatory tales of religious belief, in that they offer the comfort that all is unfolding as part of God's greater plan. Previous generations (some might say stretching back to the very beginnings of recorded time) have had their doomsday predictors, yet the world is still here, having weathered innumerable dark eras of pestilence, war, and economic upheaval. Such predictions tend to become fewer (or at least get roundly pooh-poohed) when people feel less anxious about their futures." 2009 "May" 5 1600

"Barbara Mikkelson" 2009-03-14 "Acid was placed into in hand soap dispensers in the restrooms of rest stops in Alabama and Florida." "Claim: Acid was placed into in hand soap dispensers in the restrooms of rest stops in Alabama and Florida. FALSE Example: [Collected via e-mail, March 2009]  Beginning yesterday afternoon, it was discovered that someone replaced the hand soap in the men's restrooms with an unknown substance. The first reported incident was near I-10 at the Alabama Welcome Center in Baldwin County. Testing is being carried out by the Alabama Department of Environmental Management. This morning another incident occurred in Chilton County (b/w Montgomery and Birmingham) on I-65 where the
employee noticed that the hand soap container had been tampered with. Upon further inspection, the employee discovered that jugs in the storage area appeared to have the same material added. Sample substance appears to be acid but is enroute to the Alabama Department of Public Health for testing. It appears that Florida may have two incidents of the same nature.
 
 Be very careful when using public washrooms...especially rest areas on the Interstate. A confidential memo I just received states that someone is putting a very toxic chemical in the soap dispensers in mens and ladies rooms in Alabama Rest areas. This could be happening in other locations. Recommendation; Bring your own hand sanitizer with you. The stuff they are putting into the dispensers is very harmful is swallowed or gets in the eyes. Also burns skin.
 Origins: The threat of random malicious tampering with the everyday products we use hangs over us all. This fearsome aspect of modern life was driven home by the 1982 Tylenol murders in which ordinary use of a previously unquestioned over-the-counter headache medicine left seven people dead after cyanide was deliberately slipped into bottles of the painkiller. The fear that through no fault of our own we'll innocently end up victims of random tampering underpins a number of baseless Internet-fueled scares, including the 2000 panic about HIV-laden syringes being affixed to gas pump handles and 2004 concern about HIV-positive blood being slipped into fast food ketchup dispensers. This warning about acid having been found in hand soap dispensers at restrooms in Alabama and Florida has been in circulation since mid-March 2009. While the heads-up was based on an actual incident, the substance involved appears to have been much less harmful than originally assumed. On 9 March 2009, the presence of an unusual-smelling liquid was noticed in the men's restroom soap dispenser at a rest stop on I-65 in Clanton, Alabama. Cleaning personnel noted what they perceived as a strong caustic scent emanating from the dispensers. A similar-smelling substance was also noted in the soap dispenser of a men's restroom at a Chilton County rest area on the I-65 and at another rest stop along I-75
in Marion County, Florida. Pending analysis of the substance, the transportation department closed the affected rest areas and ordered inspections of Alabama's remaining seven welcome centers and 19 rest areas. Involved in the investigation were the Alabama Department of Transportation, Alabama Bureau of Investigation, Clanton Police, Chilton County and state Emergency Management Agencies, U.S. Geological Services hazardous materials team, and the Alabama Department of Environmental Management. According to Chilton County Sheriff Kevin Davis, the suspect substance at both Alabama locations was determined to be not a \"toxic chemical\" put into soap dispensers by some malevolent pranksters intent on harming unsuspecting rest stop users, but rather \"a different kind of soap or soap that was outdated or had separated.\" Davis noted that \"The cleaning personnel said the substance in the dispenser smelled different, but it turned out to be just soap.\" The Chilton County and Marion County finds were also determined to be harmless, according to Tony Harris, an Alabama Department of Transportation spokesman. Suspect soap was discovered at another location, the Interstate 10 welcome center in Baldwin County (near the Florida border). That facility was also closed while officials awaited test results.

"Barbara Mikkelson" 2008-12-02 "Razor blades have been found amidst merchandise sold at a Wal-Mart store in Lewistown, Pennsylvania." "Claim: Razor blades have been found amidst merchandise sold at a Wal-Mart store in Lewistown, Pennsylvania. PARTLY TRUE Example: [Collected via e-mail, November 2008]  Origins: This warning has been in circulation since mid-November 2008, and while it is true that razors have sometimes been discovered lying loose among merchandise at the Wal-Mart in Lewistown, Pennsylvania, we could not verify the specific account given above. When we called the Wal-Mart store in question and asked about the e-mail, we were told that neither a customer nor any of the sales associates working at that location had reported such an incident to the store's manager. They acknowledged that yes, razor blades have occasionally been found lying loose about the store, but that no accidents or injuries involving them have ever been reported, and that the last such find was about a year and a half ago. Such discoveries, we were told, are \"very rare.\" In general, the finding of loose razor blades or other cutting implements around retail stores is a known occasional occurrence. The inclusion of anti-theft measures on easily stealable items has prompted some shoplifters to cut merchandise out of its packaging while they are still in the store. This practice sometimes involves first appropriating razor blades or Exacto knives from that same store, using those implements to free desired items from their casings or store security tags, then discarding the tools used to open the packaging. These discards can be quite haphazard: razor blades or knives are shoved onto shelves or stashed among packaged merchandise, with little thought given to the safety of other shoppers. As to what sort of goods these thieves are after, it's everything from CDs and small electronics to cough and cold medications and weight loss formulations — anything of value that is either in a clamshell casing or has a security tag affixed to it is a target. Shoplifters, as anyone in retail well knows, will steal just about anything. It's also the case that employees who restock store shelves typically use various types of bladed instruments to open boxes and cartons, and they too may sometimes drop, lose, or accidentally leave blades from such implements in areas where shoppers might later encounter them. The bottom line is that while the incident recounted above may not have been confirmed, razor blades and similar sharp instruments that have been discarded by shoplifters (or lost by employees) are occasionally found in various retail establishments. There is therefore no protection to be gained by thinking the problem is limited to just one store at one particular location: If consumers need to be concerned about random encounters with slicing implements during their shopping forays, they need to be concerned about them in every store, not just the one named in an e-mail. However, the good news is that such finds are infrequent rather than commonplace. Ergo, while this sort of thing can happen and has happened, it's neither a new nor a common phenomenon, so you need not attempt to break any speed records in warning everyone you know about it.

"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dracula/" "false" "You may be surprised by how Dracula is actually dispatched in Bram Stoker's iconic vampire novel." "David Mikkelson" 2008-10-30 "Bram Stoker's novel 'Dracula' features a titular vampire who cannot expose himself to sunlight and is killed with a wooden stake."

No two works have had a greater influence on the \"monster\" genre of popular culture than Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (1818) and Bram Stoker's Dracula (1897). The archetypal characters introduced in these novels — the Frankenstein monster and Count Dracula the vampire — have suffused popular culture through hundreds of films, television programs, books, and other media, featuring in works as diverse as the chillingly stark silent film Nosferatu to the cheerily silly sitcom The Munsters. <IMG SRC=\"https://www.snopes.com/uploads/images/language/graphics/dracula.gif\" WIDTH=87 HEIGHT=107 BORDER=0 ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=16 VSPACE=16> It's often the case, however, that aspects of such original works become obscured by the innumerable derivatives they spawn: Elements enter the popular \"lore\" of a genre not because they were present in the progenitor work, but because they were introduced somewhere along the line in films, plays, sequels, modern updatings, or other types of adaptations. Such is the case with Bram Stoker's Dracula: Those who are familiar with the Count Dracula character of popular culture but are not well-acquainted with the original Bram Stoker version might be surprised to learn that two common elements of vampire lore are not to be found in Stoker's novel. One element that is lacking in Stoker's Dracula is the final dispatching of the titular Count through the medium of driving a wooden stake through his heart. Certainly this method of converting the UnDead into the really, truly dead (usually accompanied by a simultaneous decapitation) appears several times throughout the novel, such as when Professor Abraham Van Helsing writes to Dr. John Seward (in Chapter 15) that the latter must: Take the papers that are with this, the diaries of Harker and the rest, and read them, and then find this great UnDead, and cut off his head and burn his heart or drive a stake through it, so that the world may rest from him. Van Helsing repeats the need for staking and decapitation in Chapter 18: The branch of wild rose on his coffin keep him that he move not from it, a sacred bullet fired into the coffin kill him so that he be true dead, and as for the stake through him, we know already of its peace, or the cut off head that giveth rest. We have seen it with our eyes. In Chapter 25, Jonathan Harker details in his journal how he plans to help turn Count Dracula to dust: We have already arranged what to do in case we get the box open. If the Count is there, Van Helsing and Seward will cut off his head at once and drive a stake through his heart. Morris and Godalming and I shall prevent interference, even if we have to use the arms which we shall have ready. The Professor says that if we can so treat the Count's body, it will soon after fall into dust. And also in Chapter 25, Mina Murray requests that this procedure be performed on her should she succumb to the world of vampirism: \"Then I shall tell you plainly what I want, for there must be no doubtful matter in this connection between us now. You must promise me, one and all, even you, my beloved husband, that should the time come, you will kill me.\" \"What is that time?\" The voice was Quincey's, but it was low and strained. \"When you shall be convinced that I am so changed that it is better that I die that I may live. When I am thus dead in the flesh, then you will, without a moment's delay, drive a stake through me and cut off my head, or do whatever else may be wanting to give me rest!\" This is indeed the method by which Van Helsing dispatches Dracula's \"brides,\" and in Chapter 16 Arthur Holmwood follows similar instructions from Van Helsing in order to free his fiancée Lucy from the torment of the UnDead: Van Helsing laid a hand on his shoulder, and said, \"Brave lad! A moment's courage, and it is done. This stake must be driven through her. It well be a fearful ordeal, be not deceived in that, but it will be only a short time, and you will then rejoice more than your pain was great. From this grim tomb you will emerge as though you tread on air. But you must not falter when once you have begun. Only think that we, your true friends, are round you, and that we pray for you all the time.\" \"Go on,\" said Arthur hoarsely. \"Tell me what I am to do.\" \"Take this stake in your left hand, ready to place to the point over the heart, and the hammer in your right. Then when we begin our prayer for the dead, I shall read him, I have here the book, and the others shall follow, strike in God's name, that so all may be well with the dead that we love and that the UnDead pass away.\" Arthur took the stake and the hammer, and when once his mind was set on action his hands never trembled nor even quivered. Van Helsing opened his missal and began to read, and Quincey and I followed as well as we could. Arthur placed the point over the heart, and as I looked I could see its dint in the white flesh. Then he struck with all his might. The thing in the coffin writhed, and a hideous, blood-curdling screech came from the opened red lips. The body shook and quivered and twisted in wild contortions. The sharp white teeth champed together till the lips were cut, and the mouth was smeared with a crimson foam. But Arthur never faltered. He looked like a figure of Thor as his untrembling arm rose and fell, driving deeper and deeper the mercy-bearing stake, whilst the blood from the pierced heart welled and spurted up around it. His face was set, and high duty seemed to shine through it. The sight of it gave us courage so that our voices seemed to ring through the little vault. And then the writhing and quivering of the body became less, and the teeth seemed to champ, and the face to quiver. Finally it lay still. The terrible task was over. When he raised his head Van Helsing said to him, \"And now, my child, you may kiss her. Kiss her dead lips if you will, as she would have you to, if for her to choose. For she is not a grinning devil now, not any more a foul Thing for all eternity. No longer she is the devil's UnDead. She is God's true dead, whose soul is with Him!\" Arthur bent and kissed her, and then we sent him and Quincey out of the tomb. The Professor and I sawed the top off the stake, leaving the point of it in the body. Then we cut off the head and filled the mouth with garlic. We soldered up the leaden coffin, screwed on the coffin lid, and gathering up our belongings, came away. In the novel's climactic scene, however, it is not a wooden stake but rather two knives — a kukri and a bowie — that serve as the instruments which finally turn Count Dracula to dust: I saw the Count lying within the box upon the earth, some of which the rude falling from the cart had scattered over him. He was deathly pale, just like a waxen image, and the red eyes glared with the horrible vindictive look which I knew so well. As I looked, the eyes saw the sinking sun, and the look of hate in them turned to triumph. But, on the instant, came the sweep and flash of Jonathan's great knife. I shrieked as I saw it shear through the throat. Whilst at the same moment Mr. Morris's bowie knife plunged into the heart. It was like a miracle, but before our very eyes, and almost in the drawing of a breath, the whole body crumbled into dust and passed from our sight. Another element surprisingly absent from Bram Stoker's Dracula is the notion that vampires cannot ever expose themselves to daylight; they must return to a safe enclosure (typically a coffin) before dawn and remain there until after dark. This isn't the case in Stoker's novel: Even though Jonathan Harker muses in his journal (in Chapter 4) that \"I have not yet seen the Count in the daylight. Can it be that he sleeps when others wake, that he may be awake whilst they sleep?\" he is clearly mistaken in his assumption, as he previously had a daytime encounter with Dracula: I had hung my shaving glass by the window, and was just beginning to shave. Suddenly I felt a hand on my shoulder, and heard the Count's voice saying to me, \"Good morning.\" And as author Elizabeth Miller noted in Dracula: Sense & Nonsense, several more instances of the vampire Dracula's being out and about during daylight hours occur in the novel:         Miller noted that successive film adaptations were responsible for introducing and promulgating this aspect of the Dracula story: The motif of destruction by sunlight was introduced in the 1922 silent film Nosferatu, loosely based on Stoker's novel. Although this innovation was not adopted in the 1931 [Bela Lugosi film version of] Dracula, it resurfaced in the Hammer [Studios' Horror of Dracula] production of 1958, in which Peter Cushing dramatically pulls open the drapes to expose Christopher Lee to the deadly rays of the sun. Another variation appears in 1979, when Dracula (Frank Langella) is hoisted into the sunlight where he disintegrates. The film most faithful to Stoker in this respect is Bram Stoker's Dracula: the Count (Gary Oldman) moves about freely during daylight, but with reduced powers. <FONT COLOR=\"\" class=\"copyright_text_color_g\"><B>Last updated:</B></FONT> &nbsp; 30 October 2012

"Barbara Mikkelson" 2008-10-05 "A man's cell phone placed calls to his loved ones after his demise." "On 12 September 2008 at 4:22 p.m. in California's San Fernando Valley, a commuter train carrying 225 riders collided at a combined speed of 83 mph with a freight train run by a crew of three. In what came to be known as the Chatsworth crash, 135 people were injured (87 of whom were taken to hospitals, 46 in critical condition), and 25 died. One of the deceased was 49-year-old Charles E. Peck, a customer service agent for Delta Air Lines at Salt Lake City International Airport. He had come to Los Angeles for a job interview at Van Nuys Airport because gaining work in the Golden State would have allowed him to wed his fiancée, Andrea Katz of Westlake Village. (The pair had put off getting hitched until they were living in the same state.) This would have been his second marriage; Peck had three grown children from a previous union. His fiancé heard about the crash from a news report on the radio as she was driving to the train station to pick up her intended. Peck's parents and siblings (who live in the Los Angeles area) joined her. Peck's body was recovered from the wreckage 12 hours after the accident. Yet for the first eleven of those hours, his cell phone placed call after call to his loved ones, calling his son, his brother, his stepmother, his sister, and his fiancé. In all, his various family members received 35 calls from his cell phone through that long night. When they answered, all they heard was static; when they called back, their calls went straight to voice mail. But the calls gave them hope that the man they loved was still alive, just trapped somewhere in the wreckage. The barrage of calls prompted search crews to trace the whereabouts of the phone through its signal and to once again look through what was left of the first train, the location the calls were coming from. The calls searchers finally found Peck's body about an hour after the calls from his cell phone stopped. Charles Peck had died on impact. Yet long past his death, his cell phone had continued to reach out to many of those he cared most about, and ultimately led rescuers to his mortal remains. (As far as investigators revealed, they never found Peck's cell phone.) Ironically (and tragically), another cell phone may have played a pivotal role in causing the Chatsworth crash, the deadliest in Metrolink's history. Preliminary investigation revealed the engineer running the commuter train had failed to heed a red signal light, instead impelling his train onto a single track where a Union Pacific freight train coming the opposite direction had been given the right of way. According to teens cooperating with the investigation, they had been exchanging text messages with that engineer as the train left the station and received a final text message from him just before the collision (22 seconds before impact, according to the preliminary timeline worked out by the National Transportation Safety Board)." 2008 "Oct" 10 2000

"Barbara Mikkelson" 2008-09-04 "Electric fans left running overnight kill persons sleeping in the breeze they generate." "Although many folk beliefs take root worldwide, some remain peculiar to specific cultures. Such is the case of the South Korean conviction about \"fan death,\" a deadly fate said to await those who sleep nights in rooms where electric fans are left running. There are three primary theories as to why leaving a fan running in a closed room overnight might kill a person. None holds up to medical scrutiny, yet that does not impede belief in them: Fans don't chill air. They merely circulate it, which means the hypothermia theory doesn't survive even the first hurdle of fan use causing a marked drop in room temperature, let alone the second of such a drop being enough to lower a person's internal temperature from 37°C (98.6°F) to below 30°C (86°F). Both the suffocation and carbon dioxide theories fail on the fact that homes are far from airtight. Unless a dwelling is purposely constructed to be airtight, sufficient air should leak into and out of it to prevent suffocation. There are other, more loony, theories about what causes fan death. One asserts the fan's blades chop up oxygen molecules, rendering such mutilated air unbreathable. Another posits the fan converts oxygen into carbon dioxide. No other culture appears to regard its electric fans with trepidation, yet the belief that these air circulating devices are capable of killing in their sleep even adult men is rampant among Koreans. It doesn't help that the Korean media continues to report \"fan deaths,\" citing this form of demise every time an otherwise healthy-appearing individual is found dead in his bed. As to how seriously the threat of fan death is taken in South Korea, fan users there are cautioned to always leave a window open to counter the otherwise deadly effects. Korea's largest fan manufacturing concern, Shinil Industrial Co., issues warnings with its products telling customers to keep fans pointed away from people at night. \"This product may cause suffocation or hypothermia,\" the warning reads. The Korea Consumer Protection Board advises that \"Doors should be left open when sleeping with the electric fan or air conditioner turned on. If bodies are exposed to electric fans or air conditioners for too long, it causes bodies to lose water and hypothermia.\" Many fans sold in South Korea are equipped with timers so people don't fall asleep with the units running all night. Fan death fear is so prevalent that some Korean drivers have made it their practice to open car windows a crack before operating their vehicles' air conditioners. We can only speculate on where this belief came from. The first report of fan death dates to the early 1970s, a time when South Korea was struggling to handle higher energy prices. It's possible the government in place back then spread the rumor as a way of discouraging folks from running fans at night. Faith in fan death continues to run strong in South Korea because people everywhere yearn for the comfort of easily-grasped explanations when bad things occur, and fan death provides Koreans with that for a number of otherwise mysterious deaths. In any country, a handful of seemingly healthy individuals will be discovered dead in their beds, the cause of their demise not readily apparent. In South Korea, a country that gets hot and humid in the summer, many homes will contain electric fans which, with their owners now dead, will be still running in the morning when the bodies are discovered. Yet the one (fan still running) doesn't cause the other (sudden mysterious death); the two are independent events. As to what actually causes these mysterious deaths, the smart money is on previously undiagnosed heart problems or drug or alcohol abuse. The most telling argument against fan death is that people in other countries where fans are used overnight don't die of it." 2008 "Sep" 9 NA

"Barbara Mikkelson" 2008-07-01 "A golfer angered by a bad shot was killed by the club he threw in frustration." "Claim: A golfer angered by a bad shot was killed by the club he threw in frustration.  Example: [Collected via e-mail, June 2008]  Origins: At first blush, this story appears related to theme of the legend about an irate golfer who in a fit of pique pitched his golf bag into a water hazard, then realized his car keys were in the bag, dived into the water to retrieve it, became entangled in the weeds, and drowned — an angry golfer vents his dissatisfaction with his game on an inanimate object, with fatal results. Surprisingly, however, this particular story is true: the life of a teenage boy was indeed ended by the very club he used on a bench as a way of venting his displeasure over a bad shot. In 1994, 16-year-old Jeremy Brenno of Gloversville, New York, was killed when he struck a bench with a golf club, and the shaft broke, bounced back at him, and pierced his heart. Brenno had missed a shot on the sixth hole at the Kingsboro Golf Club and looked to vent his frustration by giving the nearby bench a good whack in retaliation. The fatal club was a No. 3 wood. Brenno's is not the only accidental death by golf club. In 2005, 15-year-old Rafael Naranjo of Gardner, Massachusetts, expired after playfully swinging a 5-iron he'd found in the street at a fire hydrant. His act caused part of the shaft, along with the head of the club, to break off and lodge in his neck. In 1951, Edward Harrison was playing a round at Inglewood in Kenmore, Washington, when the shaft of his driver broke and pierced his groin. He staggered 100 yards before collapsing and bleeding to death. In 2005, 12-year-old Chandler Hugh Jackson of Frisco, Texas, died in Cunningham, Kentucky, after apparently falling onto a broken golf club at Dogwood Hill club. A piece of the club's shaft went through the boy's chest and pierced his aorta. Barbara \"club dead members\" Mikkelson Last updated: 14 May 2015

"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/lava-lamp-death/" "true" "Ordinary objects used in unconventional ways can be harmful, even fatal." "Barbara Mikkelson" 2008-05-11 "A man was killed by an exploding lava lamp." "Sooner or later, the Grim Reaper comes for us all, but sometimes his mode of operation almost defies explanation. Take the 2004 demise of 24-year-old Phillip Quinn of Kent, Washington, who was done in by his lava lamp. An icon of the 1960s and 1970s that experienced a resurgence in popularity in the mid-1990s, lava lamps are generally considered benign items of the sort one might happily stare at for hours while in a marijuana-infused haze. They consist of blobs of wax suspended in a liquid enclosed by a glass or plastic container, the blobs rising and falling when the container is heated by a bulb at the base of the unit. The motion of the blobs is slow and rhythmic, almost hypnotic. It is therefore hard to conceive that one of these slow, soothing light shows could kill a man. Yet one did. Phillip Quinn was found dead in his trailer home with shards of glass from a lava lamp embedded in his chest, including a shard that pierced his heart. According to the medical examiner's reconstruction of the events that caused the young man's death, Quinn had been heating the lamp on the kitchen stove and likely had been standing in front of it when it exploded, then stumbled into his bedroom and died. \"Why on earth he was heating a lava lamp on the stove, we don't know,\" said Kent Police spokesman Paul Petersen. Quinn's death was ruled an accident. In 2004, a lava lamp was put to use as a weapon in an attempted murder in the Dallas area when 35-year-old Tammy Britt Miller beat her mother, 62-year-old Connie Britt, with such a lamp, stabbed her repeatedly, and smashed a large picture frame over her head before attempting to suffocate her with a plastic bag." 2008 "May" 5 2000

"Barbara Mikkelson" 2008-01-16 "A ghostly figure produced by a moth saved a train from traversing a washed-out bridge." "This story about a ghostly moth figure saving a train from disaster has circulated in a number of forms, some that are mute about the identity of any of the passengers aboard the rescued train, and some that name various important personages (including Queen Victoria) as having been saved by the ghostly figure: Example: [Tan, 1979] The British express train raced through the night, its powerful headlamp spearing the black darkness ahead. The train was carrying Queen Victoria.Suddenly the engineer saw a startling sight. Revealed in the beam of the engine's headlights was a weird figure in a black cloak standing in the middle of the tracks and waving its arms. The engineer grabbed for the brakes and brought the train to a grinding halt. He and his fellow trainsmen climbed out to see what had stopped them. But they could find no trace of the strange figure. On a hunch, he walked a few yards further up the tracks. Suddenly he stopped and stared into the fog in horror. The bridge had been washed out in the middle and had toppled into a swollen stream. If he had not heeded the ghostly figure, the train would have plunged into the stream. While the bridge and the tracks were being repaired, the crew made a more intensive search for the strange flagman. But not until they got to London, did they solve the mystery. At the base of the engine's head lamp the engineer discovered a huge dead moth. He looked at it a moment, then on impulse wet its wings and pasted it to the glass of the lamp. Climbing back into his cab, he switched on the lamp and saw the \"flagman\" in the beam. He knew the answer now: the moth had flown into the beam, seconds before the train was due to reach the washed-out bridge. In the fog, it appeared to be a phantom figure, waving its arms. When Queen Victoria was told of the strange happening she said, \"I’m sure it was no accident. It was God's way of protecting us.\" As a belief tale, this yarn has a number of interpretations. On the one hand, it can serve as confirmation that seemingly spooky events often are found to have perfectly ordinary, rational explanations once initial panic has subsided. Where others are prone to jump up and yell \"Ghost! Ghost!\" then rush screaming into the night convinced they've had a brush with the supernatural, those whose innate skepticism causes them to look further into the puzzling or frightening see in the engineer's act of investigating the lamp (and thereby discovering the dead moth) the sort of level-headed thinking that leads to the debunking of the otherwise inexplicably eerie. Yet another ghost tale laid to rest; yet another \"spook\" that turned out to be anything but (e.g., the mysterious self-driving car that a rain-soaked passenger took a ride in). Another interpretation focuses on the improbable coincidence of the moth's being drawn to the lamp's beam at just the right moment to project a menacing figure onto the tracks if the train was to be halted before plunging into the abyss. While moths are indeed attracted to light, what could have caused one to throw itself at that lamp at just the precise instant necessary to save so many lives? Surely some benevolent spirit or personal guardian guided the moth's flight, possibly the ghost of someone who had died at that very spot and now looks to safeguard others across a dangerous span (e.g., the \"ghost children\" of San Antonio). Finally, the tale can be regarded as a parable illustrating the mysterious ways by which the Almighty acts on His children's behalf, His unseen hand working miracles: [Collected on the Internet, 2006] No, the figure the engineer saw in the headlight's beam was not an angel... and yet God, quite possibly through the ministry of His unseen angels, had placed the moth on the headlight lens exactly when and where it was needed. Truly \"He will command His angels concerning you to guard you in all your ways.\" (Psalm 91:11) [Powell, 1995] Mark states that after the Resurrection, the Lord \"appeared in another form unto two of them, as they walked, and went into the country\" (Mark 16:12). Christ came in disguise! There is reason to believe He still does. Happy are the people who can recognize Him whenever He comes, in and in whatever form. So, there you have it: This all-purpose supernatural yarn can be held aloft and brandished as a confirmatory tale by those who believe in Jesus. Or angels. Or protective spirits. Or the power of skeptical thinking.Barbara \"omnibustled\" Mikkelson <b><span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\"></span>Last updated:</b> &nbsp; 14 August 2013 17 January 2008 - original" 2008 "Jan" 1 1970

Examples:  My children came home from school today, and all the talk in first and second grade was of some kind of webkinz malware. A black, red or yellow box appears in your webkinz world. If you click on the black box, a neopet pops out with a knife, and chops your webkinz' head off. The red box does the same thing. If you click on a yellow box, you loose all your webkinz possessions and \"money\". It sounds like a legend to me. But little kids are telling my kids, \"This happened to me.\" Not sure what to think.
 
 [Collected via e-mail, February 2007] My kids came home from school yesterday telling me they heard of a computer virus issues associated with their webkins (or webkinz). webkinz are stuffed animals which you can buy and then somehow use the web to play games, etc. with friends who also have the animals. The virus comes on the screen as a penguin with red eyes and ruins your PC.
 
 [Collected via e-mail, March 2007] What I am hearing is that several of the kids at school have logged onto their webkinz and when they check their house, there is a killer bear roaming around with a knife and it stabs the other animals. Supposedly a neighbor logged into hers and one of her animals was found lying in a pool of blood.
 
 [Collected via e-mail, April 2007] This webkinz virus thing is TOTALLY true. it happened 2 half my friends on webkinz. there is either some kind of gift on the floor or some kind of bomby thingy. it pops out like you got a gift. then Dr. Quack or Miss Birdie pops up, lights go out, red eyes come, it makes slashing noises on your computer, and then the lights turn on and your webkinz are dead on the floor with blood on them. You probably think that webkinz people would never do that. you are right, but NEOPETS would. Why? because they got angry that everyone went on webkinz and nobody went on neopets anymore, so they hacked into webkinz and put in some kind of virus. It is pretty scary for kids, so be careful with what you do with your webkinz and DONT GO TO YOUR ROOM!!!
 Origins: In 2005 toymaker Ganz created \"Webkinz,\" a series of plush toys fashioned in the shape of fuzzy animals. These playthings can be dressed in outfits specifically sold for such purpose and played with in the real world by their young owners, but what sets these particular dolls apart from other collections of \"plushies\" (e.g., Beanie Babies, Ty Punkies) is that each Webkinz  comes with a secret code that gives its owner access to the online Webkinz World where the purchased \"pet\" can also be created and then played with as an online version of itself. Webkinz owners buy toys, clothes and even furnishings for their pets' rooms in this cyber playland, paying for such purchases with Kinzcash, a virtual type of money gained by playing educational games on the web site or by spinning the site's \"Wheel of Wow.\" As in the face-to-face world, little girls who play with their dollies in the online world fear for their charges' safety. In the face-to-face world, what needs to be feared are horrid boys who will rip off dolls' heads just to make their owners cry, but in cyberspace it's the \"Webkinz Killer,\" a maliciously-placed element that randomly appears in Webkinz World to lay waste to the cyber versions of children's cherished plush toys. Early in 2007, the online playground was swept by rumors of this killer, which was said to lurk within Webkinz World. The rumor has taken many forms: Some say the killer is a virus that appears on the user's screen as penguin with red eyes that first lays waste to the user's Webkinz, then ruins her computer. Or that \"a black, red or yellow box appears in your webkinz world. If you click on the black box, a neopet pops out with a knife, and chops your webkinz' head off.\" (A Neopet is another type of virtual pet found on a competing site.) Or that various creatures within the Webkinz World (such as a penguin, Dr. Quack,Mrs. Duck,Ms. Birdy, or a \"killer Chihuahua\" or \"killer bear\") randomly pop up within the game to slay users' beloved playthings. As to what happens to Webkinz who encounter the \"killer,\" rumor asserts they \"have their heads chopped off\" or are set upon \"with chainsaws.\" The killer(s) \"hides behind trees and kills Webkinz\" or \"comes after them with a knife if they clicked on them in a certain way.\" Or the innocent playthings meet their gruesome ends by stooping to pick up \"some kind of gift on the floor or some kind of bomby thingy.\" Others describe that the attack or virus \"makes slashing noises on your computer, and then the lights turn on and your webkinz are dead on the floor with blood on them.\" Blood and gore appear to play large roles in these virtual deaths. Dr. Quack, the game's online physician, is frequently fingered as the Webkinz Killer. (Like their Tamagotchi predecessors, online Webkinz get sick if they're not tended to every few days. Unlike Tamagotchi, however, sick Webkinz don't die; they merely display as having green snouts and ice packs on their heads. A visit to Dr. Quack and the forking over of some Kinzcash sets that malady to rights.) As the Webkinz Killer, Dr. Quack supposedly \"will appear with red eyes and a knife and will kill the Webkinz\" or take after them \"with a chainsaw.\" Likewise, Ms. Birdy (the penguin who helps new owners through the online registration process of their pets) is also said to come after Webkinz with a chainsaw or to chase them down with a knife after her eyes turn a fiery red. As to who might have set these killers loose within the game, the rumors offer a variety of theories, such as a random computer virus somehow came to infect the Webkinz site, or the playground was deliberately assaulted by clubpenguin.com and Neopets.com (competing online virtual pet sites), or \"some kind of past employee\" caused the mayhem. (The \"angered ex-employee\" routinely appears in other rumors about something objectionable having been slipped into a product one would think wholly innocuous, such as the tale about a disgruntled artist who deliberately drew a male body part into the cover art for The Little Mermaid or the lexicographer who inserted an unusual definition for 'mutton' into the 1999 edition of Random House's dictionary.) All the tales about a \"Webkinz Killer\" are false; there just isn't any such critter. As Webkinz says about the rumor: Many people have been writing in, asking about a rumor that is going around. The rumor is about something in Webkinz World hurting Webkinz pets. The most important thing to know is that this rumor is not true at all. Nothing in Webkinz World would ever hurt your Webkinz pets. Everyone at Webkinz World Headquarters works really hard to make Webkinz World a safe, happy and fun place to play. We want you and your Webkinz pets to have a great time playing on the site. Please make sure to tell your friends that their pets are safe and the rumor is not true. Remember that we would never allow anything to hurt your Webkinz pets.

 In the online world at least, Webkinz can't die. While they might at times get sick, they can always be restored to the pink of health by a visit to Dr. Quack. Other Webkinz rumors have come to our attention. They too are false: [Collected via e-mail, April 2007] They were also told that if they kick their Webkinz (again, online), they will get special prizes and their Webkinz would bleed. And then there was the rumor that if they put \"evil\" in their user names, their pets would die! [Collected via e-mail, November 2007] Rumor going around Bexley, OH that there is a Webkinz thief that can steal your Webkinz pets while you are logged onto the site, so people are being warned not to use the site. Have heard there is a \"bloody hand\" that appears when the \"thief\" is stealing the pets/information.

 Rumors about bad things happening to cyberspatial Webkinz are just that: rumors. They are expressions of anxiety, specifically that the more one cherishes something, the more one fears harm will come to it. Few things are beloved more by little girls and boys than their favorite toys, so it is far from suprising that a rumor about these playthings being laid waste to in gory fashion in their cyberspace playground would both spread far and wide and be deeply believed by the children who have put so much of their time, energy, and even their love into their online pets. While an actual stuffed toy can be clutched to one's bosom and hidden from harm under the covers, online expressions of same cannot be so safeguarded, hence the anxiety that something will get them.

"David Mikkelson" 2007-10-31 "A spectator at a football game was killed by a flying model lawnmower." "The halftime show provided for a crowd of 45,000 fans attending the Jets-Patriots football game at Shea Stadium on 9 December 1979 was an exhibition staged by the Electronic Eagles of the Radio Control Association of Greater New York. The group's model air show, a popular entertainment previously presented hundreds of times at halftimes and other events, featured radio-controlled airplanes that performed maneuvers around the stadium, engaged in aerial dogfights, and showcased flying model planes crafted in unusual shapes. On this occasion, however, the exhibition did not go off without a hitch. Partway through the show a model plane crashed into the football field — a harbinger of tragedy to come, especially after the crowd began to grow concerned about how closely some of the aircraft were approaching to fans seated in the stands. As one spectator present later expressed his unease to the New York Times: They were sending those things right over the crowds. I had an aisle seat near an exit, and I had it in my mind that if it came near me, I would run. It seemed so stupid, so sick, to send this thing over these people. Shortly before the end of the 15-minute show, Philip Cushman, a Brooklyn auto collision repairman, lost control of the model aircraft he was guiding, a novel plane shaped like a lawnmower with a red reel and silver handle. The plane circled the stadium a few times, then abruptly nose-dived into the stands about five rows behind the Patriots' bench on the third-base side of the stadium. As the lawnmower-shaped craft plummeted into the seats, it struck two spectators, 20-year-old John Bowen of Nashua, New Hampshire, and 25-year-old Kevin Rourke, of Lynn, Massachusetts. Both men suffered serious head injuries from the incident. Kevin Rourke received emergency room treatment for a concussion and was admitted to a hospital for additional observation, while John Bowen, whom one observer at the scene described as looking \"like he had been attacked by an ax,\" underwent emergency surgery that evening. Although Rourke recovered satisfactorily and was eventually discharged from the hospital, Bowen died of his injuries four days later. Police and prosecutors began an investigation when it became apparent that Bowen was unlikely to survive his injuries, but Queens district attorney John J. Santucci said authorities \"had no reason to believe [the incident] was anything other than an accident,\" and the matter was judged to be a civil issue rather than a criminal one." 2007 "Oct" 10 1970

"Barbara Mikkelson" 2007-07-15 "The presence of electronic devices (such as iPods and cell phones) on one's body can make lightning strike injuries more severe." "Claim: The presence of electronic devices (such as iPods and cell phones) on one's body can make lightning strike injuries more severe. Status: True. Origins: If asked to imagine a type of injury that could result from the use of electronic devices such as iPods or cell phones, the average person might cite accidents caused by user inattentiveness, or perhaps hearing impairment brought on by a too-high volume of sound channeled through earpieces. But a lightning strike injury would probably be far, far, down on most people's lists of possibilities. While electronic devices don't attract lightning the way tall trees or lightning rods do, those struck from above while carrying or wearing them are likely to endure far greater injury. Said Dr. Mary Ann Cooper of the American College of Emergency Physicians and an emergency room doctor at University of Illinois Medical Center at Chicago, of lightning: \"It's going to hit where it's going to hit, but once it contacts metal, the metal conducts the electricity.\" When iPods or cell phones or pagers or any other electronic devices commonly carried by people on their bodies are struck by lightning, they can serve to make the injuries sustained in the strikes far, far worse than they would otherwise have been. For instance, a July 2007 article in The New England Journal of Medicine reported on the injuries sustained in 2005 by a 37-year-old jogger in Vancouver who was struck by lightning while plugged into his iPod. That unfortunate gentleman was thrown 8 feet in the air when a bolt of lightning blasted a nearby tree. In addition to the more usual injuries of second-degree burns on his chest and left leg, he also had two linear burns along his chest, up his neck and along the sides of his face, terminating in substantial burns to his ears. (This path corresponded with the wires between his iPod's ear buds and the unit itself.) Both his ear drums were ruptured, small bones in his ears broken, and his jaw dislocated on both sides and broken in four places. Although iPods and other electronic devices do not draw lightning down from the sky, if a person is hit while wired into one, the cataclysmic discharge of energy that would otherwise have been zapped across the outside of the body (an effect known as flashover) can travel through the unit's metallic parts and into the body, causing a greater severity of injury than otherwise would have occurred. It is the combination of metallic object in contact with human skin plus sweat that disrupts the more usual \"flashover,\" diverting the discharge into the victim rather than merely across him. In the unfortunate jogger's case, that meant the combination of his own sweat plus the presence of metal earphones in his ears caused the extreme discharge of current to be shot through his head. In July 2006, Colorado teenage Jason Bunch endured similar (albeit less severe) injuries when lightning struck a nearby tree as he was listening to Metallica on his iPod while mowing the lawn. Bunch had burns from the earphone wires (which \"dissolved into green threads\") on the sides of his face, a nasty burn on his hip where the iPod had been in his pocket, and \"a bad line up the side of [his] body,\" even though the iPod cord was outside his shirt. Lightning is nothing to mess with, even without one's personal electronic devices adding to its carnage. It ranks second only to floods in storm-related deaths in the United States — not even tornadoes or hurricanes top it in terms of lives lost. On average, 73 people are killed by lightning each year. Although folks have been struck directly by bolts from the sky, it is more common for the lightning to jump to them from nearby objects (such as trees), a phenomenon known as a side flash. There is a common misconception that if an electrical storm isn't directly overhead (that is, you aren't yet being rained upon), there exists no danger of being struck by a bolt. Truth is, lightning can and has hit people long before the rains ever came. Take the case of the aforementioned Colorado teen hit by a side flash which bounced off a nearby tree: the storm that generated the bolt which felled him was far off in the distance.

"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/plumbing-pudding/" "legend" "Rumor: Sorority house plumbing was destroyed by the stomach acids of bulimic students." "Barbara Mikkelson" 2007-07-10 "Sorority house plumbing was destroyed by the stomach acids of bulimic students." "Claim: Sorority house plumbing was destroyed by the stomach acids of bulimic students. LEGEND Examples:  A sorority house had to have all of its plumming and pipes replaced because they were leaking all over the place. Thing is, the house wasn't that old. The reason: the sorority girls barfed so much in an effort to control their weight that the acids had eroded the plumming.
 
 [Collected via e-mail, July 2007] A friend of mine mentioned today that pipes at some ballet academies in New York must be changed frequently because of such high frequencies of bullimia and other eating disorders.
 Origins: This bit of lore about sorority house plumbing destroyed by the binging and purging of bulimic students has been kicking about for several decades: the oldest print references to it we've so far encountered date ito 1987, and it is likely even older than that. According to this well-traveled tale, the plumbing in various women's housing is under constant assault from the stomach acids of gals looking to lose weight by means of throwing up whatever food they've eaten. Though usually told of sorority houses (which are assumed, for the purposes of this cautionary tale, to be filled with young women obsessed with staying as thin as possible), the legend has also been applied to other buildings where one could reasonably expect to encounter a large number of women, such as dance academies (as in the second example given above). Bulimia nervosa, better known as bulimia, is a serious eating disorder. Generally, those who engage in it overeat (\"binge\"), then seek to rid themselves of the ingested calories by \"purging.\" (Purging, by the way, does not necessarily mean vomiting. It can include any type of attempt to rid the body of that which was dined upon before those foodstuffs are digested, such as overuse of laxatives, enemas, diuretics, severely restrictive dieting, excessive exercising, etc.) The tale of the destroyed plumbing has been passed along by many over the years. A 1987 news article about a play called \"Foodfright\" (presented by the Summer Dance Workshop at the University of South Florida in Tampa) said, \"So many young dance students at a prestigious school in New York City suffered from bulimia — a disease in which a person forces him or herself to vomit so as to get rid of unwanted calories — that the bathroom plumbing wore out.\" Said Caroline Adams Miller, author My Name Is Caroline (1988) and Feeding the Soul (2002), said in a 1993 interview: \"Some college sororities are notorious for bulimia and anorexia. I've heard that some houses have plumbing problems because of all the vomiting going on.\" A 2000 news article stated: \"One local therapist was recently called in to do a seminar for a dorm at a private DC university because the plumbing in one of its toilets had rotted. The same acid from vomit that gives bulimics tooth decay had eaten through the pipes.\" In 2004 then-Miss California Veena Goel regaled a middle school audience with her account of how the plumbing in her college sorority house had to be replaced because stomach acid from all the girls with eating disorders had eaten through the metal pipes. As to whether any actual plumbing systems have been destroyed by the digestive juices of bulimic girls, we can't say. The legend is perhaps better viewed as warning to those who might be tempted to try this very damaging method of weight loss, something intended to get them to think about what regurgitated stomach acids might do to their throats and teeth.

"Barbara Mikkelson" 2007-06-27 "A pedestrian was killed by a flying fire hydrant." "Claim: A pedestrian was killed by a flying fire hydrant. TRUE Origins: Loss of life through head-on collision or rollover have become mundane events in our automotively-enhanced world; we expect to read in every morning's paper about traffic deaths on local roads and highways. While all traffic fatalities are tragedies to be grieved over, some happen in far more unusual fashion than others. Every now and then a vehicle-caused demise is so wildly at odds with what we expect of our world that it shakes the cobwebs from our heads as it serves to remind us that life can be lost in the blink of an eye and through no fault of anyone's. On 21 June 2007, 24-year-old Humberto Hernandez was killed by a 200-pound fire hydrant that came flying through the air to strike him in the head as he walked with his wife along an Oakland, California, sidewalk. The fire hydrant had been launched onto its deadly trajectory by a sport utility vehicle that crashed into it. The 2007 Ford Escape had blown a tire and swerved onto the sidewalk, striking the hydrant. Water pressure and the impact of the crash sent the fire plug flying like a \"bullet,\" said Phil Abrams, an Alameda County deputy sheriff. This was far from the first death caused by an object inadvertently launched by a vehicle, but it is somewhat unusual in that the victim wasn't in a car himself. Over the years, numerous drivers and passengers have met the Grim Reaper via tires flying off passing vehicles, but other items have also ended lives. On 28 December 2006, a ball-style trailer hitch killed 32-year-old Sean O'Shea of Encinitas, California, when it bounced up from the roadway and through his windshield, striking him in the head before coming to rest in his vehicle's back cargo area. The 5- or 6-pound hitch either fell off a truck or came off the back of a vehicle. Another death occurred in similar fashion on 30 March 1995, in Santa Clara, California. On that day, while riding as the passenger in a friend's car, 37-year-old Joanne Bergeson was struck by a car jack that flew into the vehicle; she died in the hospital a few hours later of head wounds so sustained. The jack had either been dropped by a truck traveling in front of Bergeson's vehicle or had been lying in the roadway and was kicked up by it.

"<CENTER><IMG SRC=\"https://slacktory.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Wigs-on-mannequin-heads.png\" WIDTH=590 HEIGHT=197></CENTER> Claim: Temporary black henna tattoos can cause permanent scarring. PARTLY TRUE Example: [Collected via e-mail, June 2007]  Friends- I am sending this email to the majority of my address book - please pass this one on. It is so important! We were in Seaside, Florida, 2 weeks ago and decided to allow our children to get \"henna tattoos\" - the adults decided to indulge, as well. This was done at a very nice, \"high-end\" place - next to $2 - 3 million dollar homes. I asked if it was \"safe\" for children and was assured that it was a \"natural\" dye with no consequence. 10 days later , my 7 yr. old and my 5 yr. old are having \"severe\" allergic reactions to the \"black henna\". Their tattoos will now, most likely, be permanent scars. They are reacting to PPD - a substance added to natural henna to make it more \"black\" and allow it to set more quickly. Now that my girls have been exposed to PPD - they can NEVER have their hair dyed - as it could be fatal. They can not ever use PABA - based sunscreens, they can not have \"Sulfa\" anti-biotics, they can not use most cosmetics, and they can not have most drugs ending in \"-caine\". Our first visit is to the dermatologist tomorrow and then to the allergist to determine the life long consequences of this exposure. PLEASE do not allow your children to get these \"all natural henna tattoos\" unless you are 100% sure they are pure henna (which has a much lower rate of allergic reaction). MAKE SURE THEY DO NOT CONTAIN PPD! It can be a life altering decision. Take care,
 Origins: While we can't yet confirm this particular story about the two tots permanently scarred by temporary henna tattoos applied in Seaside, Florida, the risks decried in the account are at least somewhat real. For thousands of years, people have relied on henna, an Old World tropical shrub of the loosestrife family, to color their hair and decorate their skin. Pure henna is green but dries to a dark brown or orange hue. To create body art (also known as mehndi), henna is mixed into a paste with essential oils and applied to the skin in intricate patterns. When left on the skin for at least four hours, the paste produces patterns that last up to just over three weeks. Temporary tattoos worked in pure henna are generally safe. (It is extremely rare to develop an allergic reaction to pure henna.) However, those executed in \"black henna\" are not always so. Black henna is a PPD-boosted synthetic version of the real thing. Para-phenylenediamine (PPD) is used in these concoctions to darken designs and thereby produce dramatic black patterns. Black henna can make delicate skin erupt into blistering redness that sometimes leads to permanent scarring. The reaction can also spread, causing grotesque full-body swelling, itching, and skin sloughing. Black henna is not always safe to use. Permanent scarring can result from its application, and a tattoo meant to be worn for a few days can become a lifelong mark. Also, someone who has had a bad reaction to black henna may afterwards become extra-sensitive to PPD and similar chemicals, including some antibiotics and local anesthetics. Future reactions will likely be more severe. Even when there isn't an immediate bad reaction to a tattoo worked in black henna, just having had that form of skin art can set up the wearer for misery in the future. Thanks to the concentration of PPD in the formulation used to execute skin designs (up to 15.7%), the temporary tattoo sensitizes its wearer to that chemical. More than two-thirds of hair dyes currently contain PPD or related chemicals, which means the former tattoo wearer may well experience a delayed hypersensitivity reaction when she decides years later to change her hair color. Said reaction can range anywhere from redness and irritation around the hairline and scalp to complete swelling of the face and a rash all over the body. In 2006, the American Contact Dermatitis Society named PPD its \"Allergen of the Year.\" The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has this to say about temporary or henna tattoos: Since henna typically produces a brown, orange-brown, or reddish-brown tint, other ingredients must be added to produce other colors, such as those marketed as \"black henna\" and \"blue henna.\" So-called \"black henna\" may contain the \"coal tar\" color p-phenylenediamine, also known as PPD. This ingredient may cause allergic reactions in some individuals. The only legal use of PPD in cosmetics is as a hair dye. It is not approved for direct application to the skin. Even brown shades of products marketed as henna may contain other ingredients intended to make them darker or make the stain last longer. In addition to color additives, these skin-decorating products may contain other ingredients, such as solvents. In addition to color additives, these skin-decorating products may contain other ingredients, such as solvents.
 In 2002, North Wildwood, on an island off the New Jersey shore, joined neighboring oceanfront resort Wildwood in banning henna tattoos because it found it impossible to determine which contained FDA-approved dyes and which didn't.

"Barbara Mikkelson" 2007-04-19 "Parents of a murdered Virginia Tech co-ed unthinkingly back over another of their children on the way to the airport." "Claim: Parents of a murdered Virginia Tech co-ed unthinkingly back over another of their children on the way to the airport. Status: False. Example: [Collected via e-mail, April 2007]  Origins: This e-mailed account of a sad double tragedy reached us within a day of the 16 April 2007 massacre of 32 people at Virginia Tech. Many of the forwards presented it as a \"prayer request\" asking recipients to add their supplications to those of others as they passed along the story to their acquaintances. The tale is an out-and-out fiction — nothing about it checks out. Texas news sources were silent about any of those murdered at Virginia Tech being from that area. There were no news stories surfacing in the San Antonio media about a family who backed over its eight-year-old child, a story we believe would have garnered at least some media attention whether or not the parents had another child at Virginia Tech. The Bexar County Medical Examiner's Office has no record of a child's death in the days immediately following the massacre from being run over by the family car. A 19 April 2007 Associated Press list of those killed in the Virginia Tech massacre contained 32 names, none of them matching up with the surname \"Bear.\" The updated list (published on 20 April 2007) provided information about hometowns and home states or countries of those who died. None of those who lost their lives were from Texas. The woman who penned the e-mail did so on 17 April 2007, one day after the murders in Virginia. She says she heard the story from a woman she has subsequently been advised by others has \"a history of making up tragic events.\" In the summer of 2007, these related tales began circulating in e-mail: [Collected via e-mail, July 2007] Just a note to ask for a prayer request.....

 Once again, news sources were silent about these stories — there were no news accounts about two children being bitten by snakes, let alone about them dying, or with the added detail that in their haste to secure help for the snakebit youngsters, their parents managed to back the family car over another of their children. There have been real instances of children who died after vehicles driven by their parents were backed over them in the family driveway. In January 2008, a Longmeadow, Massachusetts, woman backing out of her driveway in a sport utility vehicle ran over her 2-year-old daughter and killed her. In November 2010, a Costa Mesa, California, man ended the life of his 2-year-old son the same way. It's worth noting those 2007 tales about grief- or panic-stricken parents unthinkingly causing the death of another of their children bears some resemblance to a well-traveled urban legend about the arrival of a telegram announcing the passing of one family member sparking off a cascade of mayhem that leaves all dead.

Status: Multiple — see below. Example: [Collected via e-mail, July 2006]  They're in, In case you haven't received them yet, here are this year's Darwin Awards — the annual honor given to the person who improved the \"gene pool\" the most by killing themselves in the most extraordinarily stupid way. As always,competition this year has been keen. And the candidates this year are ... #1 IN Detroit, a 41-year-old man got stuck and drowned in two feet of water after squeezing head first through an 18-inch-wide sewer grate to retrieve his car keys. #2 A 49-year-old San Francisco stockbroker, who \"totally zoned\" when he accidentally jogged off a 100-foot-high cliff on his daily run. #3 Buxton, NC: A man died on a beach when an 8-foot-deep hole he had dug into the sand caved in as he sat inside it. Beach-goers said Daniel Jones, 21, dug the hole for fun, or protection from the wind, and had been sitting in a beach chair at the bottom Thursday afternoon when it collapsed, burying him beneath 5 feet of sand. People on the beach on the outer banks, used their hands and shovels, trying to claw their way to Jones but could not reach him. It took rescue workers using heavy equipment almost an hour to free him while about 200 people looked on. Jones was pronounced dead at a hospital. #4 Santiago Alvarado, 24, was killed in Lompoc, CA, as he fell face-first through the ceiling of a bicycle shop he was burglarizing. Death was caused when the long flashlight he had placed in his mouth (to keep his hands free) rammed into the base of his skull as he hit the floor. #5 Sylvester Briddell, Jr., 26, was killed in Selbyville, Del, as he won a bet with friends who said he would not put a revolver loaded with four bullets into his mouth and pull the trigger. HONORABLE MENTION: #6 Paul Stiller, 47, was hospitalized in Andover township, NJ, and his wife Bonnie was also injured, when a quarter-stick of dynamite blew up in their car. While driving around 2 AM, the bored couple lit the dynamite and tried to toss it out the window to see what would happen, but apparently failed to notice the window was closed. RUNNER UP: #7 TACOMA, WA Kerry Bingham had been drinking with several friends when one of them said they knew a person who had bungee-jumped from the Tacoma Narrows Bridge in the middle of traffic. The conversation grew more heated and at least 10 men trooped along the walkway of the bridge at 4:30AM. Upon arrival at the midpoint of the bridge they discovered that no one had brought a bungee rope. Bingham, who had continued drinking, volunteered and pointed out that a coil of lineman's cable lay nearby. One end of the cable was secured around Bingham's leg and the other end was tied to the bridge. His fall lasted 40 feet before the cable tightened and tore his foot off at the ankle. He miraculously survived his fall into the icy river water and was rescued by two nearby fishermen. \"All I can say\" said Bingham, \"is that God was watching out for on that night. There's just no other explanation for it.\" Bingham's foot was never located. AND THE WINNER: #8 Overzealous zookeeper Friedrich Riesfeldt (Paderborn, Germany) fed his constipated elephant Stefan 22 doses of animal laxative and more than a bushel of berries, figs and prunes before the plugged-up pachyderm finally let it fly, and suffocated the keeper under 200 pounds of poop! Investigators say ill-fated Friedrich, 46, was attempting to give the ailing elephant an olive oil enema when the relieved beast unloaded on him. \"The sheer force of the
elephant's unexpected defecation knocked Mr. Riesfeldt to the ground, where he struck his head on a rock and lay unconscious as the elephant continued to evacuate his bowels on top of him\" said flabbergasted Paderborn police detective Erik Dern. \"With no one there to help him, he lay under all that dung for at least an hour before a watchman came along, and during that time he suffocated. It seems to be just one of those freak accidents that proves that \"Shit happens!\"
 Origins: \"Named in honor of Charles Darwin, the father of evolution, the Darwin Awards commemorate those who improve our gene pool by removing themselves from it, showing us just how uncommon common sense can be,\" says Wendy Northcutt of DarwinAwards.com. Darwin Awards stories are tales that are presented as factual  accounts of the demises of people who managed to end their lives in fantastically stupid ways. Some are
works of fiction (e.g., the man who died in his sleep from breathing his own farts), some are relatively accurate recountings of actual events (e.g., the lawyer who fell through a skyscraper window while attempting to demonstrate how safe that fixture was), and a handful are wildly embellished versions of true stories (e.g., the \"pumping\" death of a 13-year-old boy in Thailand was not, as the e-mailed account would have had it, due to his having sought a sexual thrill, but happened as a result of a practical joke played upon him by two 15-year-old co-workers). On snopes.com we chronicle a number of stories that have at various times wended their way through the online world presented as Darwin Award items: if you enter \"Darwin Award\" into our search engine, it will find them all for you. Contrary to common belief, there is no panel of distinguished judges weighing each potential Darwin Award entry then sagely reaching agreement as to which deserves an official accolade. Darwin Awards e-mails have been circulating on the Internet at least since May 1991, with the earliest e-mails and newsgroups posts of this nature setting before posterity inventive works of fiction that had been labeled by their authors as true accounts of actual deaths. Years after the term \"Darwin Award\" was being used in connection with text descriptions of deaths by misadventure, a number of web sites sprang up to archive the variety of Darwin Award tales then in circulation. Those sites not only collected the fictional offerings then making the online rounds but also on their own dug up numerous true accounts of death by stupidity, thus building a vast body of such tales, some true and some not. While other sites have since faded into obscurity, one has emerged as the clear winner: DarwinAwards.com, a site owned and maintained by Wendy Northcutt. Ms. Northcutt has since authored three highly successful books based on her site. The various \"Annual Darwin Awards\" e-mails (such as the one which is the topic of this article) do not originate with DarwinAwards.com; they are put together by unknown persons. Of the eight items that make up the \"Darwin Awards 2006\" e-mail, six of them would qualify for consideration for such a prize (because the foolhardy persons who star in those tales kick the bucket), but in two of them that central figure is merely injured, making those accounts ineligible for that honor. As is the norm for such Internet-circulated lists, \"Darwin Awards 2006\" e-mail, is a mixed bag — there are some actual incidents accurately chronicled, one that we know is an out-and-out fake, and a handful of others that we can't yet authoritatively prove or disprove. Interestingly, while this compilation purports to be the 2006 list, all of its entries date from 1995 through 1998. Entry #7 (the drunk who lost a foot bungee jumping with cable off the Tacoma Narrows Bridge) is fiction. It was penned by Edward Martin III and used as the 4th entry in his \"The Top Ten 'What, No Pictures?!' ER Stories of 1995\" humor offering. From there it found its way into a 1998 newspaper-published list of stupid deaths that also presented as true incidents both the \"Failed Suicide\" legend and the \"Breasts Injure Four\" fiction, the latter of which even darwinawards.com disavowed. Entry #5 (the fellow whose friends bet him he wouldn't place a revolver loaded with four bullets into his mouth and pull the trigger) has proved resistant to confirmation: while it appears in an April 1997 \"News of the Weird\" column (which places the mishap in Selbyville, Delaware, in February 1997), it has resisted our efforts to confirm through any other source. However, we did find an entry in the Social Security Death Index that corresponded to the name, age, and state given in the tale and listed a date of death of 26 February 1997. Entry #1 is one of the accurate ones. On 28 September 1996, 41-year-old Ray Langston squeezed through an 18-inch-wide sewer grate in Detroit to try to retrieve his car keys. He became pinned headfirst in a hole and drowned in two feet of water. Entry #2 (the \"totally zoned\" stockbroker who ran off a cliff) was reported by the San Francisco Chronicle in 1996: Family members say San Francisco stockbroker Jack Sullivan followed a pattern in his life, and the one day he broke the routine it killed him. A beautiful San Francisco day persuaded Sullivan to take his normal Sunday jog a day early on a different route. The path he chose below the Lincoln Park golf course was a treacherous one, and Sullivan apparently misjudged it. Witnesses saw him jog down the coastal trail next to the 17th hole, turn and run off the cliff at the Eagle Point overlook. His body was found 200 feet below. [Sullivan's wife] said she was convinced her husband hadn't committed suicide, saying he was happy with his life and had made plans to play golf with a friend the following day. A more likely explanation, she said, is that her husband wasn't concentrating on the path because he was collecting his thoughts and making plans. \"Jack totally zoned when he ran,\" Catherine Sullivan said. \"He usually ran with a little tape recorder that he would talk into, because that's how he got his ideas.\" A beautiful San Francisco day persuaded Sullivan to take his normal Sunday jog a day early on a different route.

 Entry #3 is also accurate. Daniel Jones, a 21-year-old resident of Woodbridge, Virginia, died on 7 August 1997 when the 8-foot-deep hole he'd dug at the beach on the Outer Banks in Buxton, North Carolina, collapsed on him, burying him under 5 feet of sand. Though numerous beachgoers tried to dig him out, they were unsuccessful, and workers using heavy equipment eventually freed him almost an hour later, by which time it was too late. Entry #4 (the bicycle shop burglar done in by his own flashlight) is another the accurate ones. 25-year-old Santiago Alvarado was discovered dead on the floor of a bicycle shop in Lompoc, California, on 3 February 1997. He had apparently entered the shop through its roof. The flashlight found lodged in his throat had severed the second verterbrae in his neck and it is believed he died instantly from the injury. Entry #6, the story of the clueless self-dynamiters, is true, says the Associated Press. Around 2 a.m. on the morning of 30 September 1996, Paul and Bonnie Stiller were injured by an explosion in their car when the quarter-stick of dynamite Paul was holding went off in his hand. The couple's plan had been to light the stick and throw it from the car window, but alas, they lit the explosive before rolling down the window. Mrs. Stiller was treated then released, but Mr. Stiller was admitted to Newton Memorial Hospital with unspecified injuries. The police report said the couple had been drinking, and Mrs. Stiller was charged with driving under the influence. The Stillers were both charged with possession of explosives in a vehicle, and police said two more quarter-sticks of dynamite were found at the couple's home. The final entry, the one dubbed \"THE WINNER,\" is a tale we delved into on this site long ago. While elephants may be able to produce a large amount of excretia, the sad account of the shat-upon zookeeper is naught but a piece of Weekly World News fiction from 1998.

In this vein, the caution to not stick one's head out a moving vehicle's window becomes (in the canon of urban lore) a blood-soaked tale about a little girl on a school bus who is beheaded by a road sign, and misgivings about the relative safety of popular dance moves becomes a story about a boy who \"leaned with it, rocked with it\" a little too exuberantly, causing his neck to snap like a dry twig. That genre of tragic horror legendry includes the following examples: Several years ago there was a story told about this young couple who were going to have their little baby christened on a Sunday morning. And on the Saturday evening before the Sunday when the christening was to take place, they decided to invite some of their friends into their home for a party to celebrate the blessed event that would take place in church on the following morning. It was a cold wintry day. And as the guests began to arrive, they were greeted by the husband and wife, the parents of the small child who was to be christened. As the couples entered they tossed their coats and scarves on the bed that was adjacent to the living area. Everyone arrived at approximately the same time. After a brief time of fellowship, the couple, who were anxiously anticipating the christening of their child on the next morning, announced to those who had gathered, \"We want you to meet our little one who is the object of our celebration this evening.\" The mother excused herself to go into the bedroom to get the little baby. And in a moment the guests heard a horrifying scream. The mother had gone into the bedroom and discovered that the coats and the scarves had been carelessly thrown on the bed where she had placed the little baby. At least the first one who threw her coat on the bed did not notice that the child was there. The others followed her example, and within a matter of minutes the little child was literally smothered at his own party.  A wealthy Boston family held a christening party after the baptism of their baby. Guests and friends swarmed into their palatial home. Soon the party was in full swing. People were having a wonderful time, enjoying one another, eating, drinking, and being merry. Somebody asked, \"By the way, where's the baby?\" Instantly the mother's heart shuddered! In questioning panic, she left the room and rushed into the master bedroom where she had left her baby asleep in the middle of their large bed. There on the bed she found a huge pile of the guests' coats. The mother rushed to them and began to fling them aside as she clawed down to the bottom of the pile. To her horror she found her baby ...dead ... smothered by the coats of her guests. My friends, don't let Jesus be smothered by the coats of guests as you busy yourself running here and there overcome by the stress of the season. Although the stories recounted above of careless partygoers' causing the death of a sleeping infant by unthinkingly piling their coats onto him are naught but legend, in a tragic instance of ostension (the realization in actual life of elements key to a pre-existing urban folktale), one very real baby died in somewhat similar manner on 30 October 2011 when the 2-month-old son of 27-year-old Corrina Atuatasi of Garden Grove, California, suffocated in a pile of clothing in his mother's home. Atuatasi had left the baby unsupervised in her apartment to smoke a cigarette in the courtyard, then joined friends in another unit in the complex to have drinks with them. At some point she took a break from partying to fetch the child to the gathering, whom she had placed in a car seat. Somehow, after she and her young son returned home at approximately 4 a.m., the baby died face down in a pile of clothes. Atuatasi was arrested on a charge of involuntary manslaughter, with prosecutors asserting she either dropped the helpless infant onto the pile upon getting home or kicked him off the bed as she slept. While at first blush the legend about a baby suffocated under a pile of guests' coats would appear to be no more than a warning for parents to never to lose track of where they've laid down an infant for its nap (via the example of a grieving family's experience demonstrating why this awareness is important), the tale espouses another meaning, one aimed not merely at parents but at everyone who celebrates Christmas. The \"baby smothered under a pile of coats\" legend isn't intended as a factual account of a neglected infant's death but rather as a cautionary tale expounding upon a theme often voiced during the holiday season: that focus on the secular aspects of Christmas causes people to lose sight of the Christ child, or even to wholly forget the wee babe whose entrance into the world the festive season celebrates. The \"smothered infant\" is neglectfully left on a bed where thoughtless guests fling their coats in their rush to return to the main room and continue merrymaking, his absence from the festivity being held in his honor noticed only hours into the event, by which time he is dead. While the assembled horde remembers to party long and loud, they forget the reason why they've assembled, which is to celebrate the baptism or christening of an infant — events that, while they have their social aspects, are primarily religious. Yet the party itself eclipses its subject; in their haste to revel in the joy of the season, the thoughtless partygoers succeed with their pile of coats and casual indifference in putting the snuff on Jesus. The legend is a rather gruesome communication of \"Jesus is the reason for the season.\" It uses vivid mental images of a grieving mother clutching to her bosom the lifeless body of her adored child to drive home its admonition to not forget the Savior amid all the holiday hubbub, excitement, and commercialization inherent to Christmas." 2007 "Jan" 1 2010

"Barbara Mikkelson" 2006-12-14 "E-mail claims a Mexican woman attempted to abduct a tot from a store in Tupelo, Mississippi." "Claim: E-mail claims a Mexican woman attempted to abduct a tot from a store in Tupelo, Mississippi. Status: False. Examples: [Collected via e-mail, 2006]  Everyone please beware this Holiday Season. A couple of weeks ago a lady with two kids was shopping at JCPennys in the mall here at Tupelo. One of her sons was pretty small and he was in a stroller buckled in and the other one was older and he was walking beside her. A mexican woman came by and told the lady how cute her little baby was...well the lady told her \"Thank You\" and went on her way. A couple of minutes later the mexican woman approched the lady again telling her how cute her little baby boy was. The lady again replied with thank you. As the lady turned her back to look at a piece of clothing the oldest son started screaming. The lady turned around to find that the mexican lady had unbuckled the baby and grabbed him out of the stroller and took off with him. The lady ran after them and caught the mexican woman as the was getting out the door with her son. The only way that she caught her was the mexican woman had long hair and she pulled it and knocked her down. The lady held her in her custody until the authorities arrived. The lady was shocked when the authorities asked her if she wanted to press charges. The lady replied back with heck yeah this is my son your talking about. Come to find out the mexican lady was here illegally. They are coming here to steal our kids and carry them across the border to sell to the black market... scary I know....but I had to pass on. Now you do the same.. Thanks and have a Great Day
 
 This really happened to a relative of a girl that goes to church with me. They have the lady in custody that tried to take the baby. She was hispanic and finally admitted that she was taking the baby across the border to sell it. This was last Wednesday night, Nov. 15 at the JC Penneys at Barnes Crossing. They did not catch anyone that was accompanying the lady and
we don't know if she gave up any names. So there could still be predators out there. Warn everyone you know with small children. Very scary... Last night as our family was out eating out at a local resturant , one of my aunts shared with us a very disturbing event that happened this past Wednesday night at JC Penny. A lady was shopping with her 2 small children — one a baby in a stroller and the other a toddler that was just old enough to talk. The lady had her children both right next to her as she was looking at clothes and the toddler said \"Mama that lady just got my sister\". This mother started chasing this Hispanic lady and finally caught her by reaching out and grabbing her hair from behind. She then started screaming this woman has my baby. Security came and took care of the horrible situation and told the Mom - we can almost bet you the lady had a car waiting outside with a driver and ready to take off and sell your baby on the black market in Mexico. This mother's grateful thought was Thank Goodness my toddler could talk and tell me - because she never thought this could happen since her children were right next to her within arms reach. I am sure with the Holiday Season approaching us all, the distractions as we shop will be more - but I hope this will help us all to stay a little more alert while out and about doing our shopping. And better Yet lets all each day Ask for the Lord to Guide and protect us and our families!
 Origins: In November 2006, these accounts describing a foiled child abduction at a store in Tupelo, Mississippi, began arriving in our e-mail. Akin to other Internet-circulated tales about attempted childnappings at large stores (such as the venerable canard about kids being pulled in store washrooms to be drugged and have their hair dyed by those attempting to make off with them, or the 2006 hoax about a failed child grab at a Blockbuster in North Texas), this one also proved to be a fiction. According to Lee County Sheriff Jim Johnson and Tupelo Police Chief Harold Chaffin, the story about a Mexican woman who initially admired a shopper's baby, then grabbed it from the stroller and ran off with it was pure invention. There hadn't been any such incident — no brave mom who seized the would-be abductor by her long hair and held her until police arrived, no baby-stealing illegal immigrant now behind bars awaiting trial, no ring of kidnappers frequenting Tupelo-area stores in search of product for a Mexican black market in American infants. The Mall at Barnes Crossing, a venue where the alleged foiled abduction was said to have taken place, did succeed in tracing the e-mails to their source. Mall manager Jeff Snyder indicated no legal action was contemplated against the rumor's originator, but he noted that this could well be the last time the Mall would be inclined to be so lenient regarding damage done to its reputation. The false story spread from inbox to inbox because it invoked not just the specter of the child-abducting stranger (a frightening enough figure all on its own) but melded into it a bogeyman of the moment, the illegal immigrant from south of the border. While illegal immigration into the U.S. from Mexico has long been a problem, prior to 2006 it was less of a concern to those not living in border states. In 2006, however, the illegal immigration issue was pushed to the center of the political arena, with some of that pushing taking the form of unsubstantiated rumors positioning all those who come into the U.S. on the sly as violent criminals. The fictive Mexican woman of this tale is presented as a kidnapper of small children, and not even one propelled by misguided maternal desire into taking youngsters so she could become their mother, but one motivated purely by avarice, in it for the cash that selling the purloined tots would bring. She is wholly and irredeemably evil and therefore held up as an example of the sort of person a \"look the other way\" attitude towards illegal immigration has allowed into the country. Her theft is not merely that of social services, it is of defenseless children; the cost of having her here is not merely a small increase in taxes paid by the typical family, but the risk that the next tot she or her compatriots snatch will be yours.

Status: False. Example: [Collected via e-mail, 2006]  Hi all, I wanted to pass the word on something that happened to one of Campbell's preschool friends Friday night after the Tanglewood Carnival. We had been there also & seen this little girl (5 yrs old) and her dad, said hello, played, etc. Then we ran into him again Sat night (on our date night) and he told us about what happened after they left Friday night. First they went to Tom Thumb then afterwards to Blockbuster where two men approached her and him and basically tried to abduct her. The dad said he reacted quickly, grabbed the little girl and started kicking one of the men until he was down on the ground. The other guy started backing up (not a normal reaction if they weren't up to something) and ran away. The other guy eventually got up and ran away too and they left in a red pickup truck. He said they were around 35 and 45 years old, Caucasian men. The dad said that it seemed almost like a professional job, that he felt that the guy approaching him from behind was about to hit him in the head. He got the feeling they were trying to round up kids (?) for some purpose. He heard them talking in the store before it all happened and said he had an uneasy feeling about them from the start. They called the police and gave a full report. This dad also told us he had heard that something similar had happened in Tom Thumb where a mom was having to play tug of war with her child and a man trying to take the child. That's about all he knew of that story. Anyway, just wanted to pass this information along. Please forward to anyone with kids & tell your babysitters, grandparents, etc. who may not be as aware of things like this.
 Origins: In October 2006, this account of a foiled child abduction outside a video rental store in Ft. Worth began circulating on the Internet. The frightening story caused numerous parents in North Texas to contact local police to ask if such kidnappings as described in the e-mail were taking place. Police have stated the tale is a hoax. They tracked the rumor to its source, a man who had falsely claimed two men had tried to grab his daughter at a Blockbuster video store on South Hulen. According to police, the man told the story to another parent, who believed him and wrote the original e-mail, which ended up getting passed on and spread across North Texas. Interestingly, in nearby Plano at about the same time, a youngster told police a man driving a red pickup had chased him near his home a week earlier. The news story, titled \"Child Escapes Attempted Kidnapping,\" said the boy was not harmed, and the man drove away. Note the presence of the red pickup in the e-mailed alert about child abductions. Was there a real occurrence in Plano that fit the warning, or did a kid who'd seen the e-mail (or heard it being discussed) let his overactive imagination fill in the blanks and either weave a story of whole cloth or misremember an innocuous incident involving a red truck as a far more sinister encounter?

No adolescent girl named Carmen Winstead or Jessica Smith died in such fashion, in Indiana, or in any other U.S. state \"about six years ago\" (i.e., around 2000). We searched for news reports about such a death and found none. This tale is nothing but fiction, a typical chain letter of the sort favored by pre-teens. Its key difference lies in its recommended mode of transmission: rather than imploring recipients to mail (or e-mail) it to others, it requires them to post it on social networking sites (originally MySpace, now Facebook). As is common with \"luck generation\" or \"ill luck avoidance\" chain stories, particularly the infamous \"Bloody Mary\" tale, a specific dire outcome is promised those who do not speed the tale on its way (the ghost of the murdered girl will seek them out and kill them), with proof of the danger provided via the included news about the sorry fate that befell someone who failed to heed those instructions (his dead body discovered in the sewer, \"his neck broke and his face skin peeled off\"). We discuss two other examples of this type of chain story here: one (\"Bed Reckoning\") uses a seemingly spooky photo; the other (\"Skinned Flick\") builds upon a fictitious Instant Message exchange." 2006 "Oct" 10 2000

"Barbara Mikkelson" 2006-08-21 "Several actors have kicked the bucket in front of an audience." "Long part of the canon of contemporary lore is the tale of an unfortunate actor who expires on stage, his adoring audience unaware of his sudden deceasement because they think his collapse part of the show — while they clap and cheer at the brilliance of his death scene performance, unknown to them he is gasping his last. What follows is a quick romp through a growing list of those who died in the blaze of the footlights or on camera, or who were rumored to have met the Grim Reaper while treading the boards. At least one thespian death actually does match the legend (see if you can find it). Sports figures are not included in this compilation, even though a great many of them have expired while doing their thing as the public watched. This French playwright and actor-manager collapsed during the fourth performance of his newly penned Le Malade Imaginaire (The Hypochondriac). Overwhelmed by a coughing fit, he was carried to his home in the Rue de Richelieu, Paris, where he died. This Austrian conductor died in Munich at the age of 55 while conducting Act II of Wagner's Tristan and Isolde. During a radio show (a round table discussion with four others on Hitlerism), Woolcott suffered a heart attack at 7:15 p.m. and died in hospital four hours later. Hundreds of people tuned into the show were unaware anything was amiss. Indeed, listeners reported that the writer, known for his incisive and sometimes stinging comments, seemed to have taken less than his usual part in the broadcast. Rhythm and blues recording star Johnny Ace died during a show he was giving in Houston, but did so offstage. During a five minute break, the singer was amusing himself with a game of Russian Roulette (one bullet in the chamber). He lost. Tyrone Power suffered a heart attack during the filming of a fencing scene in Solomon and Sheba in Madrid, Spain. He died only minutes after being loaded into an ambulance. As famed comedian Parkyakarkus, Harry Einstein expired while performing at a Friars Club roast for Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz. He collapsed onto Milton Berle's shoulder. Chief conductor at the Royal Concertgebouw in Amsterdam, van Beinum was taken ill after rehearsing the first two movements of a Brahms symphony, and died immediately after stepping off the podium aged 58. Just after he completed his second-act aria in Verdi's La Forza del Destino (The Force of Destiny) at the New York's Metropolitan Opera, Warren plunged face-forward onto the stage. The curtain was rung down, and it was announced a half hour later the singer had died of a massive stroke. This aviation pioneer and legendary movie stunt pilot died in Yuma, Arizona, during the filming of The Flight Of The Phoenix. As three motion picture cameras ground away, his plane hit a small sand dune, overturned and disintegrated. Though semi-retired from stunt work, Mantz was covering for his partner, Frank Tallman, who'd six weeks earlier broken his leg pushing his son's go-cart.

This half of Britain's Morecambe and Wise comedy team died in hospital the day after suffering a heart attack during a curtain call of a performance in Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire. He was 58 years old. Hexum died of a gunshot wound after he accidentally shot himself in the head with a .44-caliber magnum pistol loaded with blanks while on the set of the TV series Cover-Up.

Handcuffed and chained, he was lowered into the hole. Assistants shoveled three feet of soil onto the casket, then a truck poured concrete into the hole. As they were topping up the cement, the level suddenly dropped eighteen inches. Fifteen minutes of excavating later, rescuers reached Burrus, but it was too late — he'd been crushed.

When the dummies were unloaded and replaced with blanks, the metal tip remained behind in the gun's cylinder. As soon as the blank went off, its explosive force propelled the dummy tip through the gun barrel — and into Lee's body.

 Origins: This tragic story about a ten-year-old boy contracting HIV through the ingestion of a variety of foods has been
circulating on the Internet at least since May 2005.  In its earliest incarnation, the death-dealing foodstuff was said to be panipuri, a stuffed dumpling appetizer common in India. By March 2006, the deadly ingestible was being described as \"a fast food take-away,\" and by June 2006 it had become pineapple. No matter what the food, the rumor about a child contracting AIDS in this fashion is false. The Centers for Disease Control emphatically says people cannot acquire HIV from consuming food that has been handled by an HIV-infected person: Except for rare cases in which children consumed food that was pre-chewed by an HIV-infected caregiver, HIV has not been spread through food. The virus does not live long outside the body. You cannot get it from consuming food handled by an HIV-infected person; even if the food contained small amounts of HIV-infected blood or semen, exposure to the air, heat from cooking, and stomach acid would destroy the virus. The HIV virus does not long survive outside its host medium of human bodily fluids: blood, semen, vaginal fluid, breast milk, saliva, tears. (Which is not to say HIV can be transmitted by every one of those — according to the Centers for Disease Control, \"Contact with saliva, tears, or sweat has never been shown to result in transmission of HIV.\") The CDC reports that except under laboratory conditions, HIV is unable to reproduce outside its living host, and therefore it does not spread or maintain infectiousness outside its host. Were HIV-tainted blood to be mixed into food, the virus would neither survive nor multiply and replenish while it was still viable. Although such cases are rare, the CDC confirms that people have acquired HIV through oral contact with, or swallowing of, HIV-laden bodily fluids. However, no known infections involving oral transmission of HIV have so far come from contact with, or ingestion of, a food product or beverage; all such infections involved sexual contact. The summer of 2006 saw a rumor similar to the panipuri/pineapple one at work in the off-line world. Police in Qufu, China, were called upon to investigate a story that someone had injected watermelons grown in Fanji (a town in the Linquan county) with HIV-tainted blood. Linquan watermelons normally fetch higher prices than do those from other regions, and the farmers in that area had earlier in the year registered a trademark and established an association to protect their pricier watermelon crops. Once afoot, the false story served to drive down the price of Linquan watermelons, and sales of the fruit quickly declined. As one Linquan farmer reported, prior to the rumor's appearance watermelons he'd harvested sold out, but after the rumor had spread only a small fraction of his crop was bought. Police suspected the whisper was started by someone looking to reap commercial benefit. The rumor about HIV being passed to a ten-year-old boy via his eating of food items echoes a theme found in other urban legends, that of dread disease contracted by random innocent parties engaging in what should be safe activities — for example, AIDS acquired via a prick from a needle affixed to the handle of a gas pump, by ingesting HIV-laden blood added to restaurant ketchup dispensers, through eating pizza to which HIV-laden semen had been added; flesh-eating contagion passed on the skins of bananas imported from Costa Rica; and Weil's Disease contracted via soda cans encrusted with rat urine. Such rumors are society's way of expressing its disquiet about having to co-exist with dread contagion even in medically advanced times.

"David Mikkelson" 2006-07-19 "A circus dwarf bounced sideways off a trampoline and was swallowed by a hippopotamus." "Some faux news stories (often ones invented by tabloids such as the Weekly World News) are so bizarrely appealing to the world at large that they continue to live on no matter how many stakes are driven through their hearts. Thus, despite having long since been \"debunked,\" far out tales about ogling women's breasts being \"good for a man's health\" or an employee's dying at his desk and going completely unnoticed by his co-workers for five days continue to circulate as \"real news\" year after year and are even occasionally reprinted as fact by the legitimate press. So it is with the story of the hapless circus dwarf who supposedly died when he bounced off a trampoline straight into the maw of a hippopotamus, a tale that has been disseminated via the Internet for nearly thirty years now, with occasional appearances in straight news media along the way: From the Las Vegas Sun: An Austrian circus dwarf died recently when he bounced sideways from a trampoline and was swallowed by a hippopotamus. Seven thousand people watched as little Franz Dasch popped into the mouth of Hilda the Hippo and the animal's gag reflex forced it to swallow. The crowd applauded wildly before other circus people realized what has happened. As far as we've been able to ascertain, the \"Hippo Eats Dwarf\" story made its Internet debut in 1994, when it was posted to a USENET newsgroup as part of a collection of odd news accounts taken from National Lampoon magazine's \"True Facts\" feature (where it was attributed to the Las Vegas Sun newspaper). Although many of the other items appearing in that \"True Facts\" collection along with the \"Hippo Eats Dwarf\" tale might seem to be nothing more than inventive fiction, they appear to be \"real\" in the sense that (true or not) they were taken from standard news sources. (For example, the account of fraternity members at the University of Washington being caught in possession of stolen sheep while \"dressed in their underwear, with white grease on their hands and peanut butter and other substances on their bodies\" was in fact reported in the Chronicle of Higher Education.) Where the hippo-dwarf incident ostensibly took place isn't even clear, as the three-sentence summary quoted above is ambiguous: Was the deceased an Austrian dwarf working for a circus of indeterminate locale, or was he a dwarf of unidentified nationality employed by an Austrian circus? Either way, since many circuses typically engage in tours, we can't assume his fatal plunge took place in Austria. Nonetheless, despite conducting extensive searches of databases that index newspapers from the U.S. and around the world, we have been unable to find any evidence that this news story ran in the Las Vegas Sun (or any other newspaper) prior to its initial appearance on the Internet or in National Lampoon. The closest items we could find were 1990 news stories from the UK about a three-ton hippo named Hilda (apparently a popular appellation for the large creatures, perhaps due in part to the influence of popular children's books written and illustrated by Richard Scarry) who briefly escaped onto the grass verge of the A303 near Thruxton, Hampshire, after the trailer carrying her from Longleat Safari Park in Wiltshire to Windsor Safari Park overturned. (Unfortunately, Hilda did not survive the process of being tranquilized and re-loaded into the truck.) The \"Hippo Eats Dwarf\" tale experienced a renaissance when it was published by Thailand's Pattaya Mail newspaper in 1999. That version set the incident in northern Thailand, changed the ill-fated dwarf's name to \"Od,\" and added some rather dubious details (such as noting that Hilda was \"a vegetarian who had not previously digested a circus performer\" and that the police sent the circus trampoline out \"for forensic analysis\"): A circus dwarf, nicknamed Od, died recently in the North when he bounced sideways from a trampoline and was swallowed by a yawning hippopotamus which was waiting to appear in the next act. Vets on the scene said Hilda the Hippo had a gag reflex which automatically caused her to swallow. They added in mitigation that the hefty creature was a vegetarian who had not previously digested a circus performer. Unfortunately, the 1000 plus spectators continued to applaud wildly until common sense dictated there had been a tragic mistake. Police said the trampoline has been sent for forensic analysis. The Pattaya Mail's account was quickly picked up and re-published by several Australian newspapers, including the Daily Telegraph, the Advertiser, and the Sunday Mail, leading to another round of \"Look at this genuine news story!\" sightings. The story has continued to grow since then, picking up even more loopy embellishments about vegetarianism, alcoholism, and laxatives along the way: The vets said it was the first time the hefty vegetarian had ever eaten a circus performer. Her keeper commented that although Hilda had a slight weight problem, she was on a strict diet which did not include dwarves. Police said the trampoline had been sent for forensic analysis on pretense that it might be faulty. The Police commented that there is no evidence to support a suicide by the circus performer despite his past history of alcoholism. The vets have administered a laxative to the Hippopotamus in order to speed the recovery of the circus performer's remains. Scanned copies of various newspaper re-printings of the Pattaya Mail article have been circulated on the Internet, lending credence to the notion that \"Hippo Eats Dwarf\" was a creditable news story:   The Express' \"Beachcomber\" columnist penned a tongue-in-cheek column about the phenomenon of the mutating \"Hippo Eats Dwarf\" tale a few years ago, in which he noted: A friend recently alerted me to a curious news item about a dwarf being eaten by a hippopotamus. The story concerned something described as a \"freak accident\" at a circus in Thailand where a trampolining dwarf named Od bounced into the mouth of a yawning hippo and was swallowed. The story left several questions unanswered. What happened to the hippo? Was it a dwarf hippopotamus? And above all, is the whole tale a piece of fiction? On researching the matter, I discovered much to arouse my suspicions. For example, people say the whole thing is an urban myth dating back at least to 1999, while even five years before that, the Manchester Evening News is said to have run a story about Austrian dwarf Franz Dasch who bounced off a trampoline into the mouth of a hippo named Hilda. There are only two possibilities: either the story is one of those practical jokes masquerading as fact that does the rounds every few years to ensnare a new pack of gullible readers, or Hilda is a serial killer among circus hippos with a consuming passion for dwarfs. The change in name and nationality of the dwarf strongly suggests the urban myth hypothesis, but we cannot dismiss the other possibility. Based on the lack of any reputable source to document the expiration of a trampoline-bouncing Austrian circus dwarf at the hands (er, mouth) of a Hippopotamus amphibius, we have to opt for the former alternative (i.e., practical joke masquerading as fact).

"Claim: Kid dies doing the latest dance step in a video. Status: False. Example: [Collected on the Internet, 2006]  [Note: Actually, \"Lean Wit It, Rock Wit It\" is the work of Dem Franchize Boyz. Down Four Life (D4L) is best known for the chart topper \"Laffy Taffy.\"] Origins: Whispers about a death taking place in the \"Lean Wit It, Rock Wit It\" video first reached us in April 2006. According to the best traveled version of the story, one of the girls who appeared in the early part of the video broke her neck while following the song's exhortations. Less common was a variant in which a boy who viewed the video snapped his neck trying to copy the moves of the professional dancers. Searches for news stories about a \"Lean Wit It, Rock Wit It\" demise have proved fruitless, leading to the conclusion that there was not such a death, neither in the video, nor of a child watching it. Such a tragedy would have been reported upon had it occurred, no doubt leaving many up in arms about the toll taken by the latest dance craze and determined to ban the song from the airwaves. Most assuredly, a fatality of that nature would not have passed unnoticed and uncommented upon. The tale is an urban legend, one that was kicking about twenty-two years earlier, albeit then told about a different person in a different video. In 1984 a similar rumor mesmerized the young people of that day. According to the scuttlebutt back then, 12-year-old Alfonso Ribeiro of the Broadway show \"The Tap Dance Kid\" died in a Michael Jackson video when one of his many breakdancing moves snapped his neck. Although the false story's spread was somewhat slowed by the youngster's continued good health (as evidenced by his appearance on Donahue and a People article on him in July of that year), breathless \"Did you hear about the kid who died in the Michael Jackson video?\" whispers continued to circulate. Failing to heed the news of his own death, Ribeiro later that year advanced his career by becoming an actor in the television sitcom Silver Spoons. He continues to be active as an entertainer to this day, and is perhaps best known for another television role he undertook in 1990, that of preppy, uptight \"Carlton Banks\" in The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. Grisly deaths of children is a recurring element in contemporary lore. Lurid fictions about the gruesome demises of kids are used to teach youngsters about the perils believed to be inherent to certain activities and so direct them away from taking such risks (e.g., through a cautionary tale about a little girl beheaded by a road sign, children are taught to keep their various body parts inside the school bus). Children who have achieved a measure of celebrity are sometimes invoked for this purpose (e.g., \"Little Mikey\" of the LIFE cereal commercials who supposedly expired from ingesting a combination of soda and Pop Rocks, \"Buffy\" of Family Affair who purportedly died à la Isadora Duncan through her scarf getting caught up in the wheels of a school bus). Tales about talented dancers who kick the bucket through engaging in the wild contortions of particular dance moves is part of that; though false, such stories work to discourage those who might otherwise be tempted to mimic gyrations that others (particularly parents) deem fraught with peril. They also serve as expressions of teen anxiety, in that the moves so flawlessly executed in the video look dangerous even to the young people yearning to try them.

"Barbara Mikkelson" 2006-05-04 "Internet-circulated list entitled \"2003 Darwin Awards\" details actual deaths." "Claim: Internet-circulated list entitled \"2003 Darwin Awards\" details actual deaths. Status: A number of real entries, one unknown, and one fiction. Example: [Collected on the Internet, 2006]  These awards are given each year to bestow upon (the remains or estate of) that individual, who through single-minded self-sacrifice, has done the most to remove undesirable elements from the human gene pool. Just think...until these events, these same people were walking the streets like normal people. 5th RUNNER-UP: Goes to a San Anselmo, California man who died when he hit a lift tower at the Mammoth mountain ski area while riding down the slope on a foam pad. 22-year old David Hubal was pronounced dead at Central Mammoth Hospital. The accident occurred about 3 a.m., the Mono County Sheriff's department said. Hubal and his friends apparently had hiked up a ski run called Stump alley and removed some yellow foam protectors from lift towers, said Lt. Mike Donnelly of the Mammoth Lakes Police Department. The pads are used to protect skiers who might hit towers. The group apparently used the pads to slide down the ski slope and Hubal crashed into a tower. It has since been investigated and determined the tower he hit was the one with its pad removed. 4th RUNNER-UP: Goes to Robert Puelo, 32, was apparently being disorderly in a St. Louis market. When the clerk threatened to call the police, Puelo grabbed a hot dog, shoved it into his mouth and walked out without paying. Police found him unconscious in front of the store. Paramedics removed the six-inch wiener from his throat where it had choked him to death. 3rd RUNNER-UP: Goes to poacher Marino Malerba of Spain, who shot a stag standing above him on an overhanging rock and was killed instantly when it fell on him. 2nd RUNNER-UP: \"Man loses face at party.\" A man at a West Virginia party (probably related to the winner last year, a man
in Arkansas who used the .22 bullet to replace the fuse in his pickup truck) popped a blasting cap into his mouth and bit down, triggering an explosion that blew off his lips, teeth, and tongue. Jerry Stromyer, 24, of Kincaid, bit the blasting cap as a prank during the party late Tuesday night, said Cpl. M.D. Payne. \"Another man had it in an aquarium hooked to a battery and was trying
to explode it. It wouldn't go off and this guy said I'll show you how to set it off.\" He put it into his mouth, bit down and it blew all his teeth out and his lips and tongue off, Payne said. Stromyer was listed in guarded condition Wednesday with extensive facial injuries, according to a spokesperson at Charleston Area Medical Division. \"I just can't imagine anyone doing something like that,\" Payne said. 1st RUNNER-UP: Doctors at Portland University Hospital said an Oregon man shot through the skull by a hunting arrow is lucky to be alive and will be released soon from the hospital. Tony Roberts, 25, lost his right eye last weekend during an initiation into a men's rafting club, Mountain Men Anonymous (probably known now as Stupid Mountain Men Anonymous) in Grants Pass, Oregon. A friend tried to shoot a beer can off his head, but the arrow entered Robert's right eye. Doctors said that had the arrow gone 1 millimeter to the left, a major blood vessel would have been cut and Roberts would have
died instantly. Neurosurgeon, Doctor Johnny Delashaw, at the University Hospital in Portland said the arrow
went through 8 to 10 inches of brain with the tip protruding at the rear of his skull, yet somehow managed to miss all major blood vessels. Delashaw also said that had Roberts tried to pull the arrow out on his own he surely would have killed himself. Roberts admitted afterwards that he and his friends had been drinking that afternoon. Said Roberts, \"I feel so dumb about this.\" No charges have been filed, but the Josephine County district attorney's office said the
initiation stunt is under investigation. Now, THIS YEAR'S WINNER: (The late) John Pernicky and his friend, (the late) Sal Hawkins, of the great state of Washington, decided to attend a local Metallica concert at the George Washington amphitheater. Having no tickets (but having had 18 beers between them), they thought it would be easy to \"hop\" over the nine foot fence and sneak into the show. They pulled their pickup truck over to the fence and the plan was for Mr. Pernicky, who was 100 pounds heavier than Mr. Hawkins, to hop the fence and then assist his friend over. Unfortunately for (the late) Mr. Pernicky, there was a 30-foot drop on the other side of the fence. Having heaved himself over, he found himself crashing through a tree. His fall was abruptly halted (and broken, along with his arm) by a large branch that snagged him by his shorts. Dangling from the tree with a broken arm, he looked down and saw some bushes below him. Possibly
figuring the bushes would break his fall, he removed his pocket knife and proceeded to cut away his shorts to free himself from the tree. Finally free, Mr. Pernicky crashed into holly bushes. The sharp leaves scratched his ENTIRE body and now, without the protection of his shorts, a holly branch penetrated his rectum. To make matters worse, upon landing his pocket knife penetrated his thigh. Hawkins, seeing his friend in considerable pain and agony, threw him a rope and tried to pull him to safety by tying the rope to the pickup truck and slowly driving away. However, in his drunken haste, he put the truck into reverse and crashed through the fence landing on his friend and killing him. Police arrived to find the crashed pickup with its driver thrown 100 feet from the truck and dead at the scene from massive internal injuries. Upon moving the truck, they found John under it half-naked, scratches on his body, a holly stick in his rectum, a knife in his thigh, and his shorts dangling from a tree branch 25 feet in the air. Congratulations gentlemen. You win. And some more idiots have been removed from the gene pool.
 Origins: \"Named in honor of Charles Darwin, the father of evolution, the Darwin Awards commemorate those who improve our gene pool by removing themselves from it, showing us just how uncommon common sense can be,\" says Wendy Northcutt of DarwinAwards.com. Darwin Awards stories are tales that are presented as factual  accounts of the demises of people who managed to end their lives in fantastically stupid ways. Some are
works of fiction (e.g., the man who died in his sleep from breathing his own farts), some are relatively accurate recountings of actual events (e.g., the lawyer who fell through a skyscraper window while attempting to demonstrate how safe that fixture was), and a handful are wildly embellished versions of true stories (e.g., the \"pumping\" death of a 13-year-old boy in Thailand was not, as the e-mailed account would have had it, due to his having sought a sexual thrill, but happened as a result of a practical joke played upon him by two 15-year-old co-workers.) On snopes.com we chronicle a number of stories that have at various times wended their way through the online world presented as Darwin Award items — if you enter the phrase \"Darwin Award\" into our search engine, it will find them all for you. Contrary to common belief, there is no panel of distinguished judges weighing each potential Darwin Award entry then sagely reaching agreement as to which deserves an official accolade. Darwin Awards e-mails have been circulating on the Internet at least since May 1991, with the earliest e-mails and newsgroups posts of this nature setting before posterity inventive works of fiction that had been labeled by their authors as true accounts of actual deaths. Years after the term \"Darwin Award\" was being used in connection with text descriptions of deaths by misadventure, a number of web sites sprung up to archive the variety of Darwin Award tales then in circulation. Those sites not only collected the fictional offerings then making the online rounds but also on their own dug up numerous true accounts of death by stupidity, thus building a vast body of such tales, some true and some not. While other sites have since faded into obscurity, one has emerged as the clear winner: DarwinAwards.com, a site owned and maintained by Wendy Northcutt. Ms. Northcutt has since authored three highly successful books based on her site. The various \"Annual Darwin Awards\" e-mails (such as the one which is the topic of this article) do not originate with DarwinAwards.com; they are put together by persons unknown. The distinction between \"Darwin Awards\" stories versus \"dumb criminals\" tales or just generic \"stupid people\" yarns is lost on some of those anonymous anthologizers, so not every entry in such compilations would qualify under the rules laid out by DarwinAwards.com (i.e., that subjects' boneheaded acts cause them to be removed from the gene pool). Surprisingly, a number of the incidents described on this particular list actually happened. However, we begin this examination with one where the books are still open. The veracity of the 5th runner-up story, about a young man who met the Grim Reaper when the foam pad he was sliding down a ski hill on struck the lift tower the pad had been stripped from, is something we haven't yet confirmed. While the item has been circulated online since at least 1996, and the name of the lad who supposedly slid himself to death was Matthew David Hubal (rather than just David Hubal, as the list above describes him), we haven't turned up any news stories supporting such an occurrence. While some of the places we've looked have helpfully pointed towards checkable sources within the print media (e.g., The Guardian, Sacramento Bee, Associated Press), our searches through those news outlets failed to turn up any articles about the death, and searches of other news sources met with similar results. Our own scribbled notes from 1998 indicate a date of death for Matthew David Hubal of 25 March 1994, yet this long after the fact, our memory fails as to where that date came from. However, while we can't confirm that particular death, we know others have died in such fashion. On 17 February 1996, 26-year-old David Dehaven met his end in such fashion after using a bumper pad purloined from a lift tower as a sled. His improvised toboggan crashed into a padded boundary post at Steamboat Ski Resort in Colorado. On 4 February 2008, the makeshift sledge British vacationer David Monk was riding at a resort in the Italian Alps crashed into safety barriers at the foot of a ski slope, killing him. The sledge had been fashioned from the foam barrier encasing the ski lift tower that proved Monk's undoing. One of the true tales is that of the 4th runner-up, the account of a man who stole a hot dog only to choke to death on it. The 32-year-old Robert Puelo did indeed end his days as described on 10 October 1994. Paramedics who attempted to save his life did retrieve a six-inch length of frankfurter from his throat after he died, plus three smaller chunks of the dog, similarly lodged. Unverified (at least at this time) is the tale presented as the 3rd runner-up, that of the unfortunate poacher done in by the animal he shot when it landed on him. While a brief mention of this story did appear in a newspaper's round-up of unusual stories from 1993, no other supporting evidence has so far appeared. And even that brief mention changed the story a bit in claiming that the poacher went to his final reward in England, not Spain. The 2nd runner-up account of a lad who succeeded in his attempt to set off a blasting cap by biting down on it is another strange-yet-true tale. On 18 March 1986, a 24-year-old man named Jerry Stromyer did indeed blow off his lips, teeth and tongue in this manner. Also true is the 1st runner-up, the story of a fellow who took an arrow in his noggin when he allowed a friend to attempt to shoot a beer can off his head. On 1 May 1993, the 25-year-old Anthony Roberts lost his right eye to this male-bonding misadventure and almost lost his life in the bargain. The unemployed carpenter did in fact state at a press conference afterwards, \"I feel stupid.\" However, the entry identified as \"This Year's Winner\" is naught but fiction. The story about an attempt to crash a Metallica concert gone woefully wrong has been kicking about the Internet since 1997, sometimes as a stand-alone tale, and sometimes as an item added to other lists of \"dumb people\" anecdotes. Numerous searches done in 1997 and in the years since have failed to turn up as much as an obituary in support of this yarn. While absence of evidence is not usually conclusive proof of falsehood, if dying with a stick of holly up your ass doesn't get your name in the paper, nothing will.

"Barbara Mikkelson" 2006-03-16 "A child suffocated while playing a \"Chubby Bunny\" marshmallow-stuffing game." "Actual occurrences can sometimes take on folkloric lives of their own, making the shift from news stories to cautionary tales through emotional responses to elements of those events. That was the case with the 4 June 1999 death of 12-year-old Catherine \"Casey\" Fish, who did indeed die while playing the marshmallow-stuffing game known as \"Chubby Bunny\" — descriptions of her death have become part of the cautionary lore spread among parents. The rules of \"Chubby Bunny\" require competitors to enunciate that phrase with marshmallows stuffed in their mouths. No swallowing or chewing is allowed, and any participant who gags, coughs, or spits is \"out\" of the game. The winner is whichever child manages to utter the expression through the largest number of marshmallows. Casey Fish choked on four marshmallows and collapsed during the annual Care Fair held at Hoffman Elementary School, a grade school in Chicago's North Shore area, and died at the Glenbrook Hospital a few hours later. The \"Chubby Bunny\" competition was to have been part of the day's activities and would have been supervised by a teacher. However, Casey began playing the game with some of her friends when her teacher momentarily left the area ten minutes before the scheduled start of the \"Chubby Bunny\" competition to have a word with a janitor. As Casey choked, the teacher was summoned back to the room, but he arrived too late to head off the youngster's death. Casey's death was reported by the media at the time of the incident. But, unlike many news stories about the death of a child, the deceased sixth-grader's story was told and retold in ensuing months, primarily via The Oprah Winfrey Show, which talked about the case (including airing interviews with the distraught parents) in January, March, and June 2000. The tale of how Casey's life ended continued to surface in the news as her parents pursued a civil suit against the school district, asserting that a failure to properly supervise the children led to the death of their daughter. (In 2005, her parents settled their lawsuit for $2 million.) All of this additional attention served to keep the story in circulation. The folkloric shift this real-life tragedy has taken involves the mode of death. While a very real youngster did indeed lose her life through playing \"Chubby Bunny,\" she did so through choking on the intact confections in her mouth, not (as developing lore would have it) via the marshmallows' somehow breaking down to form a windpipe-clogging glue. In the example quoted above, the bonbons were said to have \"emulsified\" — that is, turned into a liquid mass. Another Internet-spread description of the death says \"The marshmallows were heated in the mouth and throat and effectively turned into a sticky enough substance that it could not be removed by conventional attempts at first aid.\" Yet another version claims that \"The marshmallows, warming-up to body temperature, took on the form of her air passage, and choked her to death.\" We know the marshmallows did not eventually turn into a sticky, fatal mass after Casey held them in her mouth for a while because, during the lawsuit brought by Casey's parents, Casey's best friend testified seeing her pal's lips turn purple just a few seconds after she had put the marshmallows into her mouth. While marshmallows can be quickly melted into a thick liquid, goopy substance in a pot on the stove (as anyone who has made Rice Krispies squares will attest), the temperature inside the human mouth is not sufficient to reduce them to that state. Absent chewing or licking, a marshmallow can be held in one's mouth approximately 15 minutes before it entirely disappears, its bulk gradually dissolving and being swallowed across the span of that quarter hour. At no point in that process does the resultant fluid become thick or gluey — it is thin, watery, and easily swallowed. The danger presented by the game comes not from the marshmallows being rendered into a suffocating goo in the human mouth by the heat of that environment, but from their bulk. In the zeal to best others, a child may stuff more of the confections into his mouth than he can cope with, potentially lodging one in his throat where it will block his windpipe the way a cork would. It is not any special \"melting\" property inherent to marshmallows that makes the game hazardous, but rather that the marshmallows take up so much space, and their consistency makes them difficult to remove either via the Heimlich maneuver or with medical instruments. On 13 September 2006, another \"Chubby Bunny\" death occurred when a 32-year-old Janet Rudd choked on a marshmallow and collapsed while participating in the game at a fair in London, Ontario. Emergency crews were unable to remove the blockage from her throat at the scene; she was taken to a hospital where she was revived, but she died later that evening." 2006 "Mar" 3 1990

"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/boughd-out/" "true" "“The body was in plain view of the entire apartment complex [and] they all didn’t do anything.”" "Barbara Mikkelson" 2005-10-27 "Bodies of suicide victims have been mistaken for Halloween decorations."

A few decades ago, Halloween decor amounted to a lone jack-o-lantern left grinning in a home's window as a welcome to trick-or-treaters. More recently, that aspect of the annual candy-grab has been elevated to dizzying displays of orchestrated spectacle even as the door-to-dooring of costumed tykes has dwindled to the merest trickle in some areas. The more sedate homeowners unbend enough to set out a plastic skull or two or festoon their property's shrubbery with fake cobwebs, but their more exuberant neighbors go whole hog with the spooks and gore, strewing a coffin here, a skeleton there, and a hanging man somewhere or other. It is that last bit which has contributed to an occurrence of the most macabre sort. Having become accustomed to over-the-top Halloween ornamentation and even inured to it, in October 2005, passersby mistook a suicide by hanging for a fright night prop. On 26 October 2005, the corpse of a 42-year-old woman was left suspended in public view for hours in Frederica, Delaware, because her lifeless body was assumed to be yet another Halloween display. The unnamed woman hung herself from a tree located across a moderately busy road from some homes. Her body, suspended about 15 feet above the ground, could easily be seen from passing vehicles. State police spokesman Cpl. Jeff Oldham and neighbors said people noticed the body around 7:30 that morning but dismissed it as a holiday prank. Authorities arrived at the scene at 11:00 to begin the process of examining the scene and removing the body. The deceased lived about a quarter-mile from where her body was discovered. Similarly, in mid-October 2009 the decomposing body of a 75-year-old suicide victim sat undisturbed on the balcony of the deceased's home in Marina del Rey, California, for several days because neighbors assumed it was merely part of a Halloween display: Mostafa Mahmoud Zayed had apparently been dead [for three days] with a single gunshot wound to one eye. He was slumped over a chair on the third-floor balcony of his apartment on Bora Bora Way, said cameraman Austin Raishbrook, who was on the scene when authorities were alerted to the body. Neighbors told Raishbrook that they noticed the body [three days earlier] \"but didn't bother calling authorities because it looked like a Halloween dummy,\" he said. \"The body was in plain view of the entire apartment complex [and] they all didn't do anything,\" Raishbrook said. \"It's very strange. It did look unreal, to be honest.\" An investigator with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said the case is an \"apparent suicide,\" and declined to comment further. These grisly accounts of suicides being mistaken for Halloween tomfoolery is the reverse of what we've previously seen: deliberate attempts at presenting spooktacular visual effects resulting in actual, accidental demises. All too often, young persons called upon to stage fake hanging scenes as part of scary tableaux have fatally miscalculated, thereby ending their lives.

LOOK IT UP N GOOGLE Origins: We began encountering this tale in our inbox in late June 2005. Almost two months later, near the end of August 2005, versions mailed to us began including this coda: ps guys..i looked it up on google and it really happened. creepy eh? i dont normally do these..but this one kind of bothered me a little bit. heres the article.\"Smith sisters murdered anonymously In 1993, two sisters were brutally murdered in the small-town community of Plainfield, wisconsin. Lisa Smith, 19; and her sister, Sarah Smith, 15; were attacked in their parent's home on the night of November 17th, around 1:30AM. Sarah was found stabbed and strangled in the bed where she had been sleeping. Her sister Lisa was found hanging in her sister's closet, skinned alive. Police conducted an extensive investigation, but to no avail. The motives for the attack were never discovered, nor was the attacker ever found. The only lead athorities had was a log found in Lisa's computer, showing a series of threatening messages sent through an Internet Relay Chat service. The case was closed in October of 2000.\"  Plainfield, Wisconsin, is a community of less than a thousand people located in central Wisconsin. As its one claim to fame, it was the hometown of Ed Gein, a farmer who was convicted of murdering one woman in 1957 and confessed to having killed another in 1954. His notoriety came, however, from his use of dead bodies: he mutilated the corpses of women, cutting off a variety of their body parts and fashioning these into macabre items. As one might suspect, murder in Plainfield is relatively rare. As one might further suspect, no two teen girls named Lisa and Sarah Smith were murdered in that town in 1993, nor their parents a number of years later. The story is fiction, plain and simple, just another example of the 'bad things will happen to you if you don't forward this chain letter' genre. (The concept is stated explicitly in its text: \"this is a death chain. if you dont send this in the next hour the parents will kill you at night.\") We discuss another example of this type of chain letter — one that uses a photo to tell its chilling tale — in our \"Bed Reckoning\" article. Numerous inconsistencies in the Internet-circulated story provide enough clues to its being fiction that even those lacking access to online news archives should be able to dismiss it as an attempt to yank their chains: If all this seems too silly to bother dissecting, we initially thought so too. Then we read this discussion at alexlab.com, which shows at least some folks have been taking the story somewhat seriously." 2005 "Sep" 9 1950

"Claim: An Internet-circulated list entitled \"2005 Darwin Awards\" details actual mishaps and demises. MIXTURE Example: [Collected via e-mail, 2005]  Darwin Award Winners: 1. When his 38-caliber revolver failed to fire at his intended victim during a hold-up in Long Beach, California, would-be robber James Elliot did something that can only inspire wonder. He peered down the barrel and tried the trigger again. This time it worked..... And now, the honorable mentions: 2. The chef at a hotel in Switzerland lost a finger in a meat cutting machine and, after a little hopping around, submitted a claim to his insurance company. The company expecting negligence, sent out one of its men to have a look for himself. He tried the machine and lost a finger. The chef's claim was approved. 3. A man who shoveled snow for an hour to clear a space for his car during a blizzard in Chicago returned with his Vehicle to find a woman had taken the space. Understandably, he shot her. 4. After stopping for drinks at an illegal bar, a Zimbabwean bus driver found that the 20 mental patients he was supposed to be transporting from Harare to Bulawayo had escaped. Not wanting to admit his incompetence, the driver went to a nearby bus stop and offered everyone waiting there a free ride. He then delivered the passengers to the mental hospital, telling the staff that the patients were very excitable and prone to bizarre fantasies. The deception wasn't discovered for 3 days. 5. An American teenager was in the hospital recovering from serious head wounds received from an oncoming train. When asked how he received the injuries, the lad told police that he was simply trying to see how close he could get his head to a moving train before he was hit. 6. A man walked into a Louisiana Circle-K, put a $20 bill on the counter, and asked for change. When the clerk opened the cash drawer, the man pulled a gun and asked for all the cash in the register, which the clerk promptly provided. The man took the cash from the clerk and fled, leaving the $20 bill on the counter. The total amount of cash he got from the drawer...$15. (If someone points a gun at you and gives you money, is a crime committed?) 7. Seems an Arkansas guy wanted some beer pretty badly. He decided that he'd just throw a cinder block through a liquor store window, grab some booze, and run. So he lifted the cinder block and heaved it over his head at the window. The cinder block bounced back and hit the would-be thief on the head, knocking him unconscious. The liquor store window was made of Plexiglas. The whole event was caught on videotape. 8. As a female shopper exited a New York convenience store, a man grabbed her purse and ran. The clerk called 911 immediately, and the woman was able to give them a detailed description of the snatcher. Within minutes, the police apprehended the snatcher. They put him in the car and drove back to the store. The thief was then taken out of the car and told to stand there for a positive ID. To which he
replied, \"Yes, officer, that's her. That's the lady I stole the purse from.\" 9. The Ann Arbor News crime column reported that a man walked into a Burger King in Ypsilanti, Michigan, at 5 a.m., flashed a gun, demanded cash. The clerk turned him down because he said he couldn't open the cash register without a food order. When the man ordered onion rings, the clerk said they weren't available for breakfast. The man, frustrated, walked away. A 5-STAR STUPIDITY AWARD WINNER!
10. When a man attempted to siphon gasoline from a motor home parked on a Seattle street, he got much more than he bargained for. Police arrived at the scene to find a very sick man curled up next to a motor home near spilled sewage. A police spokesman said that the man admitted to trying to steal gasoline and plugged his siphon hose into the motor home's sewage tank by mistake. The owner of the vehicle declined to press charges, saying that it was the best laugh he'd ever had. In the interest of bettering human kind please share these with your friends and family ... unless of course one of these 10 individuals by chance is a distant relative or long lost friend. In that case be glad they are distant and hope they remain lost.
 Origins: \"Named in honor of Charles Darwin, the father of evolution, the Darwin Awards commemorate those who improve our gene pool by removing themselves from it, showing us just how uncommon common sense can be,\" says Wendy Northcutt of DarwinAwards.com. Darwin Awards stories are tales that are presented as factual  accounts of the demises of people who managed to end their lives in fantastically stupid ways. Some are
works of fiction (e.g., the man who died in his sleep from breathing his own farts), some are relatively accurate recountings of actual events (e.g., the lawyer who fell through a skyscraper window while attempting to demonstrate how safe that fixture was), and a handful are wildly embellished versions of true stories (e.g., the \"pumping\" death of a 13-year-old boy in Thailand was not, as the e-mailed account would have had it, due to his having sought a sexual thrill, but happened as a result of a practical joke played upon him by two 15-year-old co-workers.) On snopes.com we chronicle a number of stories that have at various times wended their way through the online world presented as Darwin Award items — if you throw \"Darwin Award\" to our search engine, it will find them all for you. Contrary to common belief, there is no panel of distinguished judges weighing each potential Darwin Award entry then sagely reaching agreement as to which deserves an official accolade. Darwin Awards e-mails have been circulating on the Internet at least since May 1991, with the earliest e-mails and newsgroups posts of this nature setting before posterity inventive works of fiction that had been labeled by their authors as true accounts of actual deaths. Years after the term \"Darwin Award\" was being used in connection with text descriptions of deaths by misadventure, a number of web sites sprung up to archive the variety of Darwin Award tales then in circulation. Those sites not only collected the fictional offerings then making the online rounds but also on their own dug up numerous true accounts of death by stupidity, thus building a vast body of such tales, some true and some not. While other sites have since faded into obscurity, one has emerged as the clear winner: DarwinAwards.com, a site owned and maintained by Wendy Northcutt. Ms. Northcutt has since authored three highly successful books based on her site. The various \"Annual Darwin Awards\" e-mails (such as the one which is the topic of this article) do not originate with DarwinAwards.com; they are put together by unknown persons. Of the variety of accounts given in the \"Darwin Awards 2005\" e-mail, only one of them
(Entry #1) would qualify as a potential candidate for that honor as the foolhardy person who stars in the tale kicks the bucket. (Although Entry #3 also describes a death, it is an instance of a stupid person's murdering someone he is angry with, not an instance of someone's witless act resulting in his own demise.) The others are \"stupid criminal\" tales, purported recountings of incidents that their central figures survived and therefore ineligible for Darwin Awards. We have been unable to locate information about Entry #6 (the shortchanged Circle-K robber). If this was an account of an actual event, such incident failed to be mentioned in the news sources we routinely search. Entry #1, about a robber who peered down the barrel of a misfiring gun, appears almost precisely word-for-word in a Bill Bryson compilation of items supposed culled from the newspapers (but alas, said items undated and unsourced, which makes locating the original news stories behind each item problematic). While the Bryson entry at least provides a sense of how old this tale is, in that the book it appeared in was published in 1982, before that print sighting is taken as proof of the tale's veracity, it needs to be pointed out that said compilation contains the following urban legends likewise presented as \"This is true\" tales:
         Entry #2, about a finger-losing Swiss chef, also appears almost precisely word-for-word in the Bill Bryson compilation of items supposed culled from the newspapers mentioned above. Entry #3, about the thwarted snow shoveler, likewise appears almost precisely word-for-word in the Bill Bryson compilation of items supposed culled from the newspapers mentioned above. Entry #4, about the bus driver who, having lost his cargo of mental patients, collected normal folks along the route and then took them to the care facility in place of the people he was supposed to have delivered, is a wholly made-up tale which we first sighted in 1997 and which is discussed in some depth within \"Drive Me Crazy,\" our article about the sane being mistaken for lunatic asylum inmates. Entry #5, about the teen who endured head trauma from playing chicken with a train, does describe an actual event. In May 1985, 19-year-old Robert Ricketts of Bowling Green, Ohio, had his head bloodied by a Conrail train. He told police he was trying to see how close to the moving train he could place his head without getting hit. (Click here to see how it is recounted on DarwinAwards.com.) Entry #7, about the failed thief who attempted to heave a cinder block through a store's window only to have the oversized brick rebound off the Plexiglass and knock him out, was published in the 1995 compilation America's Dumbest Criminals. (Note that the inclusion of this item and the next one in that book is no guarantee of the factuality of either incident, as that volume also includes the venerable \"revenging animal\" urban legend, supposedly told of a coyote who destroyed his killers' $20,0004x4 Blazer by going to ground under it with a lit stick of dynamite tied to its tail.) While the book's authors do claim the Fraternal Order of Police, based in Nashville, received a video of the cinder block robbery attempt, we have been unable to substantiate the tale through searches of news databases. While we cannot yet confirm Entry #8, about a purse snatcher in New York who volunteered, \"Yes, officer, that's her. That's the lady I stole the purse from,\" when taken to the victim for identification, a similar tale set in Brunswick, Georgia, and related in America's Dumbest Criminals completes with the thief saying to his arresting officers, \"Yeah, that's her . . . that's the woman I robbed.\" The self-IDing thief story also mirrors this 1992 News of the Weird offering set in Minneapolis: Suspected purse-snatcher Dereese Delon Waddell in suburban Minneapolis last winter stood on a police lineup so the 76-year-old female victim could have a look at him. When police told him to put his baseball cap on his head with the bill facing out, so as to be presentable, he protested, \"No, (I'm going to) put it on backwards. That's the way I had it on when I took the purse.\" Entry #9, about the robbery of a fast food restaurant foiled by a clerk's refusal to serve onion rings during the breakfast rush, appeared in advice maven Ann Lander's column in September 1998. We contacted the Ann Arbor News to see if it had run such a story in its pages, and that publication's librarian reported they could not verify the item. Entry #10 (the \"5-Star Stupidity Award Winner!\") is another urban legend we delve into on this site. The \"gas-siphoning thief gets a bellyful of sewage\" tale has been documented as part of the urban legends canon since 1981. While it does at times appear presented as a news story, we have great difficulty believing the event could have played out in real life, given that the gas caps on RVs are located on the sides of those vehicles, whereas the release valves for draining accumulated \"brown water\" into in-ground septic tanks are almost always located on their undersides. Our disbelief and our reasons for it are discussed more fully in \"Dreaded Unleaded,\" our article about the legend. Barbara \"difficult to swallow\" Mikkelson Last updated: 23 December 2013

Status: Two real entries, the others are fiction. Example: [Collected on the Internet, 2005]  Yes, these are all true. They are finally out again. It's an annual honor given to the person who did the gene pool the biggest service by killing themselves in the most extraordinarily stupid way. Last year's winner was the fellow who was killed by a Coke machine which toppled over on top of him as he was attempting to tip a free soda out of it. And the nominees this year in reverse order are: 7. A young Canadian man, searching for a way of getting drunk cheaply, because he had no money with which to buy alcohol, mixed gasoline with milk. Not surprisingly, this concoction made him ill, and he vomited into the fireplace in his house. This resulting explosion and fire burned his house down killing both him and his sister. 6. A 34 year old white male found dead in the basement of his home died of suffocation, according to police. He was approximately 6' 2\" tall and weighed 225 pounds. He was wearing a pleated skirt, white bra, black and white saddle shoes, and a woman's wig. It appeared that he was trying to create a schoolgirl's uniform look. He was also wearing a military gas mask that had the filter canister removed and a rubber hose attached in its place. The other end of the hose was connected to one end of a hollow tube approx. 12\" long and 3\" in diameter. The tube's other end was inserted into his rectum for reasons unknown, and was the cause of his suffocation. Police found the task of explaining the circumstances of his death to his family very awkward. 5. Three Brazilian men were flying in a light aircraft at low altitude when another plane approached. It appears that they decided to moon the occupants of the other plane, but lost control of their own aircraft and crashed. They were all found dead in the wreckage with their pants around their ankles. 4. A 22 year old, Glade Drive, Reston, VA, man was found dead after he tried to use octopus straps to bungee jump off a 70 foot railroad trestle. Fairfax County police said Eric Barcia, a fast food worker, taped a bunch of these straps together, wrapped one end around one foot, anchored the other end to the trestle at Lake Accotink Park, jumped and hit the pavement. Warren Carmichael, a police spokesman, said investigators think Barcia was alone because his car was found nearby. \"The length of the cord that he assembled was greater than the distance between the trestle and the round\" Carmichael said. Police say the apparent cause of death was \"Major trauma.\" 3. A man in Alabama died from rattlesnake bites. It seems that he and a friend were playing a game of catch, using the rattlesnake as ball. The friend, no doubt a future Darwin Awards candidate, was hospitalized. 2. Employees in a medium sized warehouse in west Texas noticed the smell of a gas leak. Sensibly, management evacuated the building, extinguishing all potential sources of ignition; lights, power, etc. After the building had been eacuated, two technicians from the gas company were dispatched. Upon entering the building, they found they had difficulty navigating in the dark. To their frustration, none of the lights worked. Witnesses later described the sight of one of the technicians reaching into his pocket and retrieving an object that resembled a cigarette lighter. Upon operation of the lighter like object, the gas in the warehouse exploded, sending pieces of it up to three miles away. Nothing was found of the technicians, but the lighter was virtually untouched by the explosion. The technician suspected of causing the blast had ever been thought of as 'bright' by his peers. AND THE WINNER 1. Based on a bet by the other members of his threesome, Everitt Sanchez tried to wash his own \"balls\" in a ball washer at the local golf course. Proving once again that beer and testosterone are a bad mix, Sanchez managed to straddle the ball washer and dangle his scrotum in the machine. Much to his dismay, one of his buddies upped the ante by spinning the crank on the machine with Sanchez's scrotum in place, thus wedging them solidly in the mechanism. Sanchez, who immediately passed his threshold of pain, collapsed and tumbled from his perch. Unfortunately for Sanchez, the height of the ball washer was more than a foot higher off the ground than his testicles are in a normal stance, and the scrotum was the weakest link. Sanchez's scrotum was ripped open during the fall, and one testicle was plucked from him
forever and remained in the ball washer, while the other testicle was compressed and flattened as it was pulled between the housing of the washer, and the rotating machinery inside. To add insult to injury, Sanchez broke a new $300 driver that he had just purchased from the pro shop, and was using to balance himself. Sanchez was rushed to the hospital for surgery, and the remaining three some were asked to leave the course. This last one wouldn't normally count, because the idiot didn't die. But because he cannot reproduce as a result of his qualifying act of stupidity, we have allowed it.
 Origins: \"Named in honor of Charles Darwin, the father of evolution, the Darwin Awards commemorate those who improve our gene pool by removing themselves from it, showing us just how uncommon common sense can be,\" says Wendy Northcutt of DarwinAwards.com. Darwin Awards stories are tales that are presented as factual  accounts of the demises of people who managed to end their lives in fantastically stupid ways. Some are
works of fiction (e.g. the man who died in his sleep from breathing his own farts), some are relatively accurate recountings of actual events (e.g. the lawyer who fell through a skyscraper window while attempting to demonstrate how safe that fixture was), and a handful are wildly embellished versions of true stories (e.g., the \"pumping\" death of a 13-year-old boy in Thailand was not, as the e-mailed account would have had it, due to his having sought a sexual thrill, but happened as a result of a practical joke played upon him by two 15-year-old co-workers). On snopes.com we chronicle a number of stories that have at various times wended their way through the online world presented as Darwin Award items — if you throw \"Darwin Award\" to our search engine, it will find them all for you. Contrary to belief, there is no panel of distinguished judges weighing each potential Darwin Award entry then sagely reaching agreement as to which deserves an official accolade. Darwin Awards e-mails have been circulating on the Internet at least since May 1991, with the earliest e-mails and newsgroups posts of this nature setting before posterity inventive works of fiction that had been labeled by their authors as true accounts of actual deaths. Years after the term \"Darwin Award\" was being used in connection with text descriptions of deaths by misadventure, a number of web sites sprung up to archive the variety of Darwin Award tales then in circulation. Those sites not only collected the fictional offerings then making the online rounds but also on their own dug up numerous true accounts of death by stupidity, thus building a vast body of such tales, some true and some not. While other sites have since faded into obscurity, one has emerged as the clear winner: DarwinAwards.com, a site owned and maintained by Wendy Northcutt. Ms. Northcutt has since authored three highly successful books based on her site. DarwinAwards.com does its best to separate the wheat from the chaff, identifying for its readers which of its stories are factual and which are not. The various \"Annual Darwin Awards\" e-mails (such as the one which is the topic of this article) do not originate with DarwinAwards.com; they are put together by unknown persons. Of the seven gruesome accounts given in the \"Darwin Awards 2004\" e-mail, five fail to check out, but two are real. One entry that stands up to scrutiny is the sorry tale of a Reston, Virginia, man who foolishly taped a selection of store-bought bungee cords together, then used them to bungee jump off a 70-foot railroad trestle. The entry (#4 on the list given in the \"Example\" section above) is accurate in its details, the death occurring on 12 July 1997. The other valid entry concerns the rattlesnake used in a game of catch in Alabama. On 6 September 1995, two alcohol-fueled fools took it upon themselves to toss a rattlesnake back and forth between them by its tail. Not liking the game, the snake let both of them have it. 35-year-old Joe Buddy Caine lost his life in this pursuit, while his companion, Junior Bright, had to be hospitalized. The alleged winner of the 2004 award (which we discuss in detail on this page) is one of the false accounts. Though its fictional victim merely injures himself, according to the rules governing the Darwin Awards (as outlined in The Darwin Awards by Wendy Northcutt, published in 2000), he would have been eligible for the prize even though he survived: To win, nominees must significantly improve the gene pool by eliminating themselves from the human race in an astonishingly stupid way. [...] The prime tenet of the Darwin Awards is that we are celebrating the self-removal of incompetent genetic material from the human race. The potential winner must therefore render himself deceased, or at least incapable of reproducing. As for the others, though we've searched high and low, we could not locate substantiation for the stories about a vomiting Canadian, mooning Brazilian high-fliers, an anally intubated cross-dresser, or the technicians in Texas who used a lighter to check for a gas leak. The tale about the three Brazilians who lost control of their aircraft and crashed while attempting to moon the occupants of another plane mirrors a scenario advanced by Alan Diehl, the Air Force's chief civilian safety official from 1987 until his removal from that post in 1994. He claimed two of the three Navy airmen who lost their lives in the 1989 crash of an F-14 in Arizona had removed their clothes and were attempting to moon another F-14. Navy spokesman Cmdr. Stephen Pietropaoli said the Navy's legal review of the case concluded the airmen died of lack of oxygen after they took off their masks for what the report termed a ''stunt'' and turned off the plane's oxygen supply to cut down on the noise. An autopsy report said the pilots were recovered fully clothed. All of the charges made by Diehl of cover-ups of the true causes of aircraft accidents were investigated by the Pentagon, with the Pentagon's inspector general announcing in 1997 that he had dismissed the allegations. A rewording of the 2004 missive's opening claim that \"Last year's winner was the fellow who was killed by a Coke machine which toppled over on top of him as he was attempting to tip a free soda out of it\" prefaced the first Darwin Award account we saw back in 1991.

"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/the-amityville-horror/" "false" "\"I remember going by that house and how scary it was.\"" "Snopes Staff" 2005-04-15 "'The Amityville Horror' is based on a true story." "Some horrors just won't die, and The Amityville Horror is a case in point. The tale of a reportedly demon-infested house in Amityville, New York, became a best-selling novel in 1977 and a hit horror film starring James Brolin and Margot Kidder in 1979. Several inferior movie sequels followed in its wake (including a 3-D version), and 15 April 2005 saw the debut of a remake, this one starring Ryan Reynolds and Melissa George. Scary films are a dime a dozen, but what initially drew the public's interest to the original version of The Amityville Horror was the claim that it was based on real events. The producers of the 2005 remake were also intrigued by the Amityville case not so much due to the horror film's scary details, but because the tale was allegedly true. \"We were looking for truth in horror,\" co-producer Andrew Form told Fangoria magazine. \"I grew up in Long Island, so I was familiar with this when I was a kid. I remember going by that house and how scary it was.\"  The history of The Amityville Horror, as with The Exorcist, began with a best-selling novel. A book entitled The Amityville Horror: A True Story, written by Jay Anson, was published in 1977 and quickly scaled the sales charts. Anson was not a resident of the infamous possessed house, but a professional writer hired to pen a book based on supposedly \"true events\" that had taken place there several years earlier. The story behind the story began on 13 November 1974, when six members of an Amityville, New York, family were killed. The parents, Ronald and Louise DeFeo, were shot in bed while they slept, along with their two sons and two daughters. The sole remaining family member, Ronald Jr. (\"Butch\"), was arrested for the crime, convicted, and sentenced to prison. With the family dead (and Butch in no position to inherit the place), the house went up for sale. The horrific nature of the massacre unnerved the otherwise quiet Long Island neighborhood, though no supernatural activity was associated with the house at 112 Ocean Avenue. The following year, a new family, the Lutzes, moved into the house. George and Kathy Lutz, along with their three children, said that shortly after they moved in, their six-bedroom abode became a Hell house. It seemed that perhaps the demons that drove Butch to slaughter his family were not in his head but in the house. An unseen force ripped doors from hinges and slammed cabinets closed, noxious green slime oozed from the ceilings, a biblical-scale swarm of insects attacked the family, and a demonic face with glowing red eyes peered into their house at night, leaving cloven-hoofed footprints in the morning snow. A priest called upon to bless the house was driven back with painful blisters on his hands, famously told by a demonic voice to \"Get out!\" And so on. A local television crew did a segment on the house, bringing in several self-styled \"ghost hunters\" (including Ed and Lorraine Warren) and other alleged psychics. All agreed that a demonic spirit was in the house, and that an exorcism would be needed to stop the activity. The Lutzes left the house and took their terrifying tale with them, collaborating with Anson on the book The Amityville Horror. And, as William Peter Blatty did when he promoted The Exorcist, Anson vouched for the truthfulness of his fantastic tale: \"There is simply too much independent corroboration of their narrative to support the speculation that [the Lutzes] either imagined or fabricated these events.\" Many people expressed doubts about the events in the house. Researcher Rick Moran, for example, compiled a list of more than a hundred factual errors and discrepancies between Anson's \"true story\" and the truth. The 2005 remake promises to mine Anson's book more deeply than did the previous screenplays, including background about early Indians (whose vengeful spirits may lurk nearby) and devil-worshipping early settlers of the area. Yet, Moran explains, \"Experts told me that the tribe mentioned was not from the Amityville area at all (actually, they had inhabited the eastern tip of Long Island, 70 miles away) and that the settlers mentioned were never local residents either. Anson's tactic was clear — when strapped for good material for a book, pad it with quasi-factoids.\" And Father Pecoraro, the priest who was driven from the house by demons? According to Moran, who interviewed Pecoraro, \"He said he never saw anything in the house.\" Joe Nickell, author of Entities: Angels, Spirits, Demons, and Other Alien Beings (and who personally visited Amityville and interviewed later owners of the notorious house), also found numerous holes in the Amityville story. A few examples of these discrepancies: Over and over, both big claims and small details were refuted by eyewitnesses, investigations, and forensic evidence. Still, the Lutzes stuck to their story, reaping tens of thousands of dollars from the book and film rights. The truth behind The Amityville Horror was finally revealed when Butch DeFeo's lawyer, William Weber, admitted that he, along with the Lutzes, \"created this horror story over many bottles of wine.\" The house was never really haunted; the horrific experiences they had claimed were simply made up. Jay Anson further embellished the tale for his book, and by the time the film's screenwriters had adapted it, any grains of truth that might have been there were long gone. While the Lutzes profited handsomely from their story, Weber had planned to use the haunting to gain a new trial for his client. George Lutz reportedly still claims that the events are mostly true, but has offered no evidence to back up his claim. The Lutzes' account was likely influenced by another fictionalized story, that of The Exorcist. In fact, it is not much of a stretch to suggest that The Exorcist strongly influenced The Amityville Story: Recall that The Exorcist came out in December 1973, and demonic possession and hauntings were very much in the public's mind when the Lutzes spun their stories of diabolic activity a year or two later. The revelation that the story was based on a hoax has led to embarrassment, especially among the handful of \"paranormal experts\" who \"verified\" the fictional tale. The Lutzes must have had a good laugh at the expense of the mystery-mongering ghost hunters and self-proclaimed psychics who reported their terrifying visions and verified the house's (non-existent) demonic residents. To this day, the fact that The Amityville Horror story was an admitted hoax is still not widely known — as we often say, the truth never stands in the way of a good story. Though the story was made up by the Lutzes and further sensationalized by Anson, there were real victims of The Amityville Horror (the film, not the demons). In addition to the murdered DeFeo family, the subsequent occupants of the Amityville home have suffered a continual stream of harassment by curiosity seekers, horror fans, and gawkers who want to photograph and tour their infamous house. Then there are the people who, fooled by the films' and book's tagline, think they are partaking of works based on true events. (This article © 2005 by Benjamin Radford)" 2005 "Apr" 4 1970

Example: [Weekly World News, 1996]  Police say the tragedy occurred as the Gratzfeld College band was rehearsing the spirited American jazz classic, \"When the Saints Go Marching In.\" According to other band members, trombonist Peter Niemeyer, 19, \"got carried away\" with the music. He started gyrating and thrashing around as he played. At one point, he jerked forward and the rounded metal slide on his instrument hit trumpet player Dolph Mohr, 20, dropping him instantly to the floor. \"Niemeyer was pumping the slide very hard,\" said medical examiner Dr. Max Krause. \"But it wasn't just the force of the blow that killed Mohr. The slide struck him in the worst possible place — the vulnerable spot just behind and below the left ear. Bone fragments pierced his brain, killing him instantly.\" The incident has provoked a storm of controversy over whether or not American jazz should be played in German colleges. \"I believe the music is to blame,\" said Gratzfeld band director Heinrich Sommer. \"I was pressured to play that selection by school administrators. But I've always said jazz is dangerous music. Our musicians can't control themselves when they play it. They move and rock back and forth, creating chaos. If I had my way, American Dixieland would be outlawed in Germany. I've been directing bands for 30 years and I've never heard of anyone dying while playing a German march.\"
 Origins: If there were competition for the title of \"America's wackiest newspaper,\" the this link Weekly World News would probably win the award hands-down. Unlike other supermarket tabloids, which primarily offer a  mixture of celebrity news and gossip, shocking scandals, and health and diet tips, the WWN's stock in trade is the bizarre. Extraterrestrials, ghosts, cannibals, vampires, and half-human animals populate the pages of the WWN; articles about alien visitations, unusual deaths, Bigfoot, and impending planetary doom can generally be found in every issue. Facts are infrequent visitors to the WWN, rude party-crashers who occasionally succeed at sneaking in through the back door and are quickly hustled off the premises. Despite the mostly playful, tongue-in-cheek style of WWN articles, occasionally a WWN story will \"escape\" into the wild and be circulated on the Internet as a genuine news article (because it has been stripped of its attribution, or because a forwarder wasn't familiar with the essence of the Weekly World News); on rare occasions, a WWN piece will even resurface in the \"legitimate\" news media, reported as a factual account of a real-life event. In the last several years, all of the following topics which originally appeared in the Weekly World News were widely circulated as true:  The story reproduced above, of a trumpeter who died when struck in the head by the slide of an overenthusiastic trombonist, is another entry from the Weekly World News fiction collection, this one originally published in the tabloid on 23 January 1996. It was quickly posted to a variety of USENET newsgroups, and even though its attribution has largely remained intact as it has been republished on a variety of Internet sites over the years, it regularly surfaces in our inbox as the subject of \"Is this true?\" queries.

"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/suckered/" "mixture" "It appears a valid report about drugs confiscated by the police fell into the hands of someone with an active imagination." "Barbara Mikkelson" 2004-10-19 "Drug-laced suckers are being handed out to children in Arkansas." "Law enforcement has found lollipops that contain drugs. Someone is handing out drug-laced suckers to school children. In mid-October 2004 this warning came to our inbox scant weeks before Halloween: North Little Rock Police Department put out a warning. Someone is giving middle school & high school kids suckers that look like: Maple Leafs; Pumpkins & Santa Claus that are laced with three different TYPES
OF VERY STRONG DRUGS THAT ARE HALLUCINOGENIC, and this is STRONG ENOUGH TO KILL a child or teenager. The Police station received a tip from the Memphis, TN police. Some arrest in Memphis have been made. These suckers have turned up in Blytheville. Officials' fears that these suckers will begin to show up throughout the state. If you have children, or know someone with children, PLEASE inform them of this possible threat to our children. At first blush, it looked like a standard expression of parental anxiety typical to a season centered on children taking candy from supposedly altruistic strangers: worry about the safety of one's own trick-or-treaters was finding voice in the form of a rumor about villains handing out drug-laced suckers to kids. Yet, while baseless concern over a crime that isn't happening is certainly part of this hearsay about lollipops, it is not the all of it. This rumor is a bit of an odd duck to classify in that while the lollipop-profferring knaves pressing their drug-laced confections onto unsuspecting children in hopes of corrupting the tots are naught but fanciful imaginings, the candies as described in the alert are real. It appears that a valid report about drugs confiscated by the police has fallen into the hands of someone whose imagination added the bit about the lollipop-disguised hallucinogens being given to children. The e-mailed warning makes it appear the information has come from the North Little Rock Police Department, which was not the case. That branch of law enforcement has made it abundantly clear that it had nothing to do with the matter. On 11 October 2004, the North Little Rock Police Department posted this denial on its web site: The North Little Rock Police Department has been falsely mentioned in a circulating email about tainted Halloween candy. The North Little Rock Police Department has been the subject of a recent email making false claims about \"hallucinogenic suckers\" that supposedly originated from Memphis, TN. These suckers are described in the email as being tainted and strong enough to kill a child. THIS EMAIL STATES THAT THE NORTH LITTLE ROCK POLICE DEPARTMENT IS WARNING PARENTS AND CHILDREN ABOUT TAINTED SUCKERS IN THE SHAPE OF MAPLE LEAFS, PUMPKINS AND SANTA CLAUS. THE NORTH LITTLE ROCK POLICE DEPARTMENT HAS NEVER RECEIVED ANY INFORMATION OF THIS NATURE FROM ANY POLICE AGENCY AND HAS NEVER PROVIDED SUCH A WARNING. We are investigating the origins of this email in order to determine if any of this information is based on fact. Likewise, police in Blytheville have disavowed the claim of the adulterated suckers having turned up there. \"We have gotten several phone calls about the e-mailed information,\" said Royce Carpenter, that town's Police Chief. \"But there have been none of these suckers found in Blytheville.\" Similarly, the Memphis Police Department denied any such lollipops having being found by them or their having made arrests on such cases. Okay, so these sinister pops haven't been found in Blytheville, and there haven't been any lollipop-associated arrests in Memphis. There have also not been any reports of children in Arkansas being given suspect lollys. Those parts of the rumor are pure embroidery. However, while the candies have not shown up in Arkansas, they do indeed exist. While there aren't diabolical types lurking in anticipation of pressing them into the eager hands of treat-seeking tots, there are drug dealers selling them to customers. And there have been lollipop-related arrests in the parts of the nation where the candies have been found. The information that forms the basis of the e-mailed alert about pharmaceutical-laced suckers came from a June 2004 Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) publication. The article in question detailed a number of drug finds around the country, including the discovery in  Philadelphia of large electronic capacitors loaded with heroin, and in Nogales, Arizona, of fire extinguishers packed with cocaine. Getting illegal drugs past U.S. Customs by disguising them as innocuous items is business as usual in the drug trade. Although the more typical method is to conceal outlawed pharmaceuticals inside hollow items, sometimes what is being smuggled is incorporated into foodstuffs. The lollipops reported on by the DEA were the maple leaf and Santa head of the e-mailed caution. According to that agency, each of these bonbons weighed approximately 10 grams and were green, red, or amber in color. One cache of the candies had been confiscated by the Chicago Police in early January 2004 and another in March. These THC- and PCP-enhanced sweets known as \"dro pops\" were being sold in that city for $10 to $30 each. There were no reports of any unsuspecting parties having been made ill by the disguised drugs, let alone of any children harmed by them. (THC is the main substance in marijuana. PCP, which also goes by the name \"angel dust,\" is known for inducing violent behavior in those who take it.)  We noted earlier the Memphis Police Department denied having found such lollipops. Yet there is a Memphis connection with this rumor, because in March 2004 Captain Bill Rasco with the DeSoto County Sheriff's Department said of the corrupted sweets, \"These are going around the schools now. These things are dangerous.\" Rasco was commenting on the finds in Chicago (none of the suckers had turned up in DeSoto schools), but his remarks appeared in the Commercial Appeal, the major newspaper in Memphis, Tennessee. That article also contained something very much in line with the e-mail's \"Officials' fears that these suckers will begin to show up throughout the state\" — it said of the pops, \"The department believes they may be here in the next few days or weeks\" (which, as it turned out, was not the case). Also in the DEA article about disguised drug finds was a report of heroin-filled lollipops being seized at LaGuardia airport. In the accompanying photograph of three of the sweets broken open to reveal the brown powder stashed therein, one of the confiscated candies appeared vibrantly orange-colored, which, along with its round shape, could make it the unaccounted-for \"pumpkin\" style of lollipop talked about in the warning e-mail. If so, it would bring the number of drugs up to the online alert's three (THC, PCP, and heroin). As to why anyone would think to fashion drugs into the form of suckers for any intent other than tricking youngsters into getting high and possibly hooked, we can quickly think of three valid reasons, none of which have anything to do with luring children down the primrose path to their destruction. First, those looking to import illegal substances have a better likelihood of success if their wares can pass for something other than contraband. By concealing the drugs inside candy shells (as was the case with the LaGuardia haul), there is a far greater possibility of getting them past Customs and DEA personnel. In such instances, the lollipops are no more than temporary containers meant to be smashed open and discarded once they've served their purpose of hoodwinking those attempting to safeguard the borders. Second, a great many drug users are young adults who delight in fanciful shapes and markings on their drugs, possibly in appreciation of the whimsy of it all. Ecstasy tablets stamped with the likenesses of cartoon characters are routinely turned up by law enforcement. Though less common now, in the 1970s blotter sheets of LSD were also printed with cartoon characters (a circumstance that sparked a long-lived rumor about children tricked into applying drug-saturated rub-on \"tattoos\" to themselves). The THC and PCP Santas and maple leaves would market well among such a clientele, a fact that would not be lost on those who make it their business to vend illegal feel-goods. Third, having the ability to ingest illegal pharmaceuticals in a surreptitious manner would hold great appeal to many who use recreational drugs. Those drawn to the drug culture find at least some of its allure lies in the sense of using being a forbidden activity; by indulging in illegal substances and by so doing breaking one of Society's taboos, they come to view themselves as living daring, exciting lives in which the normal rules do not apply. For such, the ability to suck on a candy that was getting them high while having a conversation with the boss or a parent would be almost beyond price. The sense of having gotten away with something would add that little extra spice to the experience, further underscoring their self-concept of being counter-culture darlings. So, are there drug-infused lollipops? Yes, there have been, but the last ones were seen in Chicago in March 2004. Have youngsters innocent of any desire to get high been plied with these suckers by the ill-intentioned? There are no reports of this, not so much as one recorded instance. Given the span of time since these pops last surfaced and the lack of child-related incidents, we think this warning hardly the stuff of \"If you have children, or know someone with children, PLEASE inform them of this possible threat to our children.\"" 2004 "Oct" 10 2000

"Barbara Mikkelson" 2004-10-10 "A clown statue that spooked a babysitter turns out to be a knife-wielding intruder hiding in the house." "<img src=\"https://www.snopes.com/uploads/images/horrors/graphics/clownstat.jpg\" /> <hr class=\"hr-spacer\" /> <table> <tbody> <tr> <div style='aspect-ratio: / ;' class='img_tag_container'><td valign=\"CENTER\"><img src=\"/images/legend.gif\" /></td></div> <td valign=\"TOP\"><span class=\"status_color\" style=\"font-size: x-large;\"><b>LEGEND</b></span></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <hr class=\"hr-spacer\" />In the Spring of 2004, we began picking up versions of the story quoted below, in which babysitter mistakes a knife-wielding intruder hiding in the house she's watching for a clown statue. It exists in two forms: one in which the babysitter appears to be the person at risk, and one where the children are the presumed targets of the lurking man's malice. Example: [Collected on the Internet, 2004] A couple with children were trying out a new babysitter. About an hour after they left for a night on the town, they realized they had forgotten to give her their cell phone number, so one of them called her. After she wrote down the number, the babysitter asked if she could watch satellite TV in their bedroom. She had just put the children to bed and wanted to watch a particular show. (The parents didn't want their children watching too much garbage, so the living room TV did not have satellite channels.) Well of course she could watch TV in their room, they replied. The babysitter had one other request: could she put a sheet or blanket over the clown statue that was in the bedroom? It kind of made her nervous. Take the children and go to the neighbors, said whichever parent was talking to her. We'll call the police. We don't have a clown statue. The police caught the clown as he was running through the neighborhood. In the stories that feature the clown having been found in the parents' bedroom, the slant of the tale leads readers to assume it is the babysitter, not her charges, that are the predator's primary focus. (The tot-tending teen having been selected as the killer's (next) victim is a key element in another urban legend: the classic \"Babysitter and the Man Upstairs,\" in which the sitter receives a series of disturbing phone calls entreating her to check on the sleeping children and so put herself in the room with the murderer.) Yet in the tellings where the clown statue has been found in the children's room, the object of harm is the youngsters, not the young lady watching over them. Some renditions make the pedophilic element unmistakable by having a frightened child report having been touched inappropriately by something in its room, and others only hint at it via brief closing comments about the captured man having been revealed to be a sexual predator wanted in a number of states. Significantly, all the tellings we have so far encountered terminate in the bad guy not only running from the house but being captured by the police and so brought to justice. Could this indicate a subtle shift in how safe we as a society feel about our world, in that it now strikes us as right that a scary story complete with the villain giving up his evil plans and running away when confronted with discovery yet even so not being able to elude retribution? Only rarely does the legend offer any explanation for why the skulking intruder chooses to pass himself off as a statue in preference to just attacking willy-nilly:   Needless to say, homicidal maniacs and pedophiles have not commonly taken to donning clown costumes and passing themselves off as items of home decor. (Although one famous serial killer, <a href=\"https://www.carpenoctem.tv/serial-killers/john-wayne-gacy/\" target=\"gacy\" rel=\"noopener\">John Wayne Gacy,did sometimes dress as a clown, it was for the purpose of entertaining children at parties and charity events; it was not how he attired himself when torturing and murdering his victims.) Yet lack of real killer clowns to the contrary, a substantial number of folks admit to a sense of disquiet about clowns, and some actually fear them. There is something about the grotesquely exaggerated makeup that inspires a sense of unease, even menace, with this perception remarkably widespread across all age groups. (In St. Louis, a strip mall named the General Grant Center has come to be known as \"Scary Clown Plaza\" thanks to a 15-foot clown statue erected there. As the local paper said, \"We can't put our finger on what accounts for the sinister aura that seems to surround this supposedly jovial fellow, but too many folks from diverse backgrounds have commented on it to just be coincidence.\") Before we entirely dismiss the \"killer clown statue\" as naught but folklore, it should be noted that there has been at least one verifiable case of such a figure attacking someone. In 1992, in Noblesville, Indiana, a Ronald McDonald clown statue toppled onto a six-year-old girl, severing the fleshy part of her fingertip. The excised piece was reattached, but the child still had a malformed fingernail. She was awarded damages of $41,400. If the sight of clowns causes the hairs on the back of your neck to rise, not only aren't you alone, but there are online communities populated by folks who share your sense of unease: ihateclowns.net and Clownz.com are two such places. On the flip side of the coin, if you've an interest in hiring a clown, or in perhaps becoming one yourself, Clowns of America and Clowns International are worth a visit.

"Barbara Mikkelson" 2004-04-04 "Man fooled into thinking he has been executed dies of a heart attack." "Claim: Man fooled into thinking he has been executed dies of a heart attack. LEGEND Examples:  A group of Birmingham students were discussing the question of hypnosis. They decided to try an experiment and invited into the lecture room a laboratory assistant who was always causing them problems and getting them into trouble. They explained to him that no one could be made to do anything under hypnosis that they would not do when fully awake. They said that a student had been hypnotised, told to execute someone and they wanted the laboratory assistant to help them prove the student would not go through with it. They asked the assistant to kneel down with his head bent as if ready to have his head chopped off. The 'hypnotised' student was then brought in and with a suitable build-up he gently dropped a wet towel across the back of the victim's neck. Unfortunately, the assistant was of a nervous disposition and the shock brought on a heart attack which killed him.
 
 [Collected via e-mail, 2004] Another story I've heard quite a few times is about a man in England (before capital punishment was outlawed there) condemned to death by hanging. Shortly before he dies, he is told that he will have his throat cut with a knife instead. A hood is placed over his head and, instead of the sharp side, the blunt side of the knife is run across his throat. He makes gurgling noises as if he has just had his throat cut and dies. The teller usually points out that the \"experiment\" was carried out by British psychologists.
 Origins: According to folklorist Paul Smith, this legend of a faked beheading's causing the victim to expire of fright reaches back into distant times, with one well-traveled version from the 1800s set at Aberdeen University recounting the mock execution of a porter named Downie. Smith also asserts that an even earlier Italian analogy is found in a story from the 1500s wherein a jester is accidentally polished off in a staged execution. More recent tellings describe the about-to-be-deceased as a laboratory assistant who is a liability to the group (Smith, 1986) and as a thoroughly loathed \"knows it all\" freshman (Cohen, 1993), each of whom are lured to their deaths in efforts to prove hypnotized people will not do anything they would not do ordinarily. The victim's being positioned in the mind of the audience as the sort of fellow one would have no love for is far from accidental — his unsympathetic portrayal renders those regaled with the tale free to focus on the blood-chilling manner of the death absent the distraction of pity for the man who died. Likewise, little by way of compassionate urges gets in the way of the story about the condemned criminal: he obviously must have been a right rotter to be under sentence of death — and besides, he was about to kick the bucket anyway. The theme of a physically unharmed victim who passes away only because he believes himself to be dying underpins another urban legend. In \"Deadly Imaginings,\" a man trapped in a non-functioning refrigerator he presumes to be turned on perishes by way of freezing to death. Can people be fatally deceived into thinking they've been put to death? We don't honestly know, but we do point out the entire lack of genuine reports of such cases.

"Barbara Mikkelson" 2004-02-01 "Lightning strikes have killed people who were talking on the telephone." "Claim: Lightning strikes have killed people who were talking on the telephone. Status: True. Origins: Lightning ranks second only to floods in storm-related deaths in the United States. On average,  more than 60 people are killed by it each year. Not even tornadoes or hurricanes top it in terms of lives lost. We know not to be outside when electrical storms are flashing through the area, or — if we are caught by surprise — not to seek shelter under trees but instead to crouch and take the wetting until the danger has passed. Yet as aware as we are of the peril posed by summer storms, most of us naively presume we're safe from those errant bolts from the sky when we're indoors. Yet we're not. Not only have lightning strikes into the nearby ground sent massive power flares into the electrical and telecommunications wiring of proximate houses and flung volt-ridden jolts up pipes and into sinks and bath tubs, bolts themselves have come in through windows to fell occupants of domiciles. Although indoors is a far less hazardous place to be than outdoors during a thunderstorm, it is still not safe. In 1975 a lightning bolt hit a shed in Rhodesia, killing twenty-one people inside. That was the largest death toll from a single bolt. In the U.S., the largest one-bolt kill occurred in North Carolina in 1961, when eight people who had taken shelter in a tobacco barn died. Even talking on the telephone during a storm is not absolutely safe. On average one person is killed by lightning while talking on the phone each year. Standard telephones (what are coming to be called land lines, meaning handsets that are plugged into outlets within the home or office) can be somewhat of a risky proposition during an electrical storm, as the wires through which telecommunications takes place can be hit by lightning, with the resultant electrical discharge instantly zapped through nearby handsets and data ports. Yet this danger is small and the number of such strikes relatively low. Even so, as thunderstorms approach, some people opt to unplug costly electrical appliances from power outlets (lightning strikes to power lines can send catastrophic discharge into one's TV) as well as uncouple phone lines from computers and modems. These same folk don't dream of answering their phones until the storms have passed. But not everyone is that cautious, and some have paid a price. In 1998, a nine-year-old girl was jolted by a lightning strike as she talked on the telephone in the family home in Columbus, Ohio. Megan Duty was whomped by the blast while seated on a stool in the kitchen — her mother and grandmother heard a thunderous noise and looked over in time to see the girl scream and throw the phone as smoke issued from her. The child, who had turned blue and experienced trouble walking, was treated at a nearby hospital and released the same day. Other than having a bit of trouble hearing in her right ear, she afterwards appeared to be fine. In 1992, Dan Fulscher of Lincoln, Illinois, thought he'd been hit by a shotgun blast when a flash of lightning caught him while talking on the phone and threw him out of the room. His left side numb, his body covered in sweat, he spent three days in a hospital intensive care unit until feeling returned. In 2001, a Boy Scout making a scheduled call to his mother from that year's National Jamboree in Virginia was jolted when lightning hit the nearby telephone pole. The victim, 15-year-old Charlie Wilson of Beaverton, Oregon, felt searing pain from his hand up to his elbow. He was treated at a nearby hospital and rejoined the Jamboree that same day none the worse for wear. Though injuries are more common than fatalities in \"lightning coming through the phone line\" incidents, deaths have occurred in those cases too. In 1985, a lightning strike caused the death of 17-year-old Jason Findley of Piscataway, New Jersey. The teen was found dead at his grandparents' house, the receiver still clutched to his ear — he had been electrocuted by the indirect effect of a lightning strike while on the phone. In 1988, 22-year-old Laura McDowell of Montezuma, New York, was killed when lightning came through the telephone line while she was talking on the phone. She was eight months pregnant with her second child. Although cell phones being struck by bolts from the sky would seem less likely, it can happen, although probably more as a function of the person using the phone's being the tallest thing around when lightning happened to flash rather than anything having to do with the phone itself. In September 1999, a sales executive in Sri Damansara, Kuala Lumpur, was struck dead by lightning while talking on his cellular phone. The victim, 30-year-old Khor Chean Kit, was felled by a bolt after waiting out a storm in a shop for an hour and, only after the downpour eased, walking to his car while making a call. The bolt flung him several yards, and he died on arrival at a nearby clinic. Cell phones (and cordless portable phones) used indoors during electrical storms are perfectly safe because there is no wire through which the electrical discharge could travel. (The belief that lightning can \"follow the radio waves\" into a cell phone is completely unfounded.) And although some people feel cell phones pose a risk when used outdoors because lightning is attracted to metal (it's not — metal is merely good at conducting electrical currents), handsets generally contain insignificant amounts of metal.

"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/the-last-laughs-on-him/" "true" "Is the phrase \"I just about died laughing\" as much about accuracy as it is hyperbole?" "Barbara Mikkelson" 2004-01-02 "People have died laughing." "In recent decades, laughter has been touted as a possible cure for many ills, including cancer and heart trouble. But could mirth also be deadly, making the phrase \"I just about died laughing\" as much about accuracy as it is hyperbole? On 24 March 1975, 50-year-old bricklayer Alex Mitchell of King's Lynn in Norfolk, England, kicked the bucket while roaring with laughter at one of his favorite television shows, the comedy program The Goodies. The skit that precipitated Mitchell's fatal fit of glee involved a kilted Scotsman's flailing away with his bagpipe at a vicious black pudding intent upon attacking him. Mitchell was unable to stop laughing, and after twenty-five minutes of uproar gave one last \"tremendous belly laugh, slumped on the settee, and died,\" said his widow, who witnessed his passing. While Mitchell had expired from heart failure, what felled him was not a classic heart attack, but rather the result of an unusual inheritable heart rhythm disorder that routinely takes the lives of even apparently robust 20-somethings. Mitchell had Long QT syndrome, an affliction in which the heart is prone to experiencing long pauses between heart beats, especially after instances of excitement or exertion. After such an incident, the heart resets itself after a few beats, but in some cases (such as this) the person is not so fortunate. An odder account of a \"dying laughing\" incident was reported in Bangkok in 2003: An ice cream truck driver in Thailand died while laughing in his sleep. Damnoen Saen-um, 52, laughed for about two minutes yesterday and then stopped breathing, The Nation newspaper reported. Damnoen's wife tried to wake him up but he kept laughing. An autopsy suggested that he might have had a heart attack. \"I have never seen a case like this. But it is possible that a person could have heart seizure while laughing or crying too hard in their sleep,\" said Dr Somchai Chakrabhand, deputy director-general of the Mental Health Department. On the anecdotal side, Schott's Original Miscellany attributes the death of Burmese king Nandabayin in 1599 to his having \"laughed to death when informed, by a visiting Italian merchant, that Venice was a free state without a king.\" And on the fictional front, one version of the demise of Pecos Bill, the legendary cowboy hero of American folklore, has him dying from laughter after an encounter with a Boston dude: When Bill was gettin' on in years, a Boston man came down to New Mexico for a visit. He fancied himself a bit of a cowboy. Got himself one of them mail-order suits, don't ya know. The ones with the lizard skin boots, a shiny brass belt buckle, a new pair of blue jeans and a huge ten gallon hat with not a speck of dust on it. Well, when Pecos Bill saw him trying to swagger into a bar, he jest lay down on the sidewalk and laughed himself to death! Not enough information was given in the (real) cases cited above to know whether laughter was a coincidental, contributory, or causal element of the deaths, but linguistically we've been tossing about \"dying laughing\" expressions for centuries; the Oxford English Dictionary records a use of this phrase as far back as 1596 (\"Went they not quickly, I should die with laughing\"). We also employ similar phrases to indicate intense feelings of humiliation (\"I almost died of embarrassment\"), and in a more generic sense we use 'dying' to indicate great longing (\"I'm just dying to see you\") or excellence (\"It's to die for\"). It therefore comes as a bit of a shocker to realize that there might be at least a smidgen of truth buried deep beneath all this overblown emoting. Yet even if there may have been an occasional death from guffawing, it's still possible merriment is far more healthy than harmful (at least for the ones who survive). Some studies assert laughing produces beneficial effects on physical health, including decreasing the secretion of serum cortisol (a stress hormone) and boosting the blood levels of immunoglobulin A, an antibody that fights bacterial and viral infections in the upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. However, not everyone in the scientific community has jumped on this bandwagon: in a study reported upon in 2002 in Current Directions in Psychological Science (\"Is Laughter the Best Medicine?

"Barbara Mikkelson" 2003-11-12 "College student who restricts himself to only one foodstuff contracts scurvy." "Claim: College student who restricts himself to only one foodstuff contracts scurvy. LEGEND Example: [Dale, 1984]  Origins: This story has been part of the campus lore canon since at least the mid-1970s. It appears to be more common in Great Britain than it does in North America, but Canadian and American tellings of it have been recorded. Scurvy is a disease that strikes down those who are deficient in vitamin C (ascorbic acid). This illness is  relatively well contained in modern times, but in centuries past it took many lives, with its worst ravages noted among sailors whose long sea voyages kept them from having access to fruits and vegetables. (Vasco da Gama, for example, lost more than half his crew to this malady on his first trip around the Cape of Good Hope in 1497.) In 1747 lemons and oranges were fed to scurvy-riddled sailors with dramatic results, and in 1795 the British navy began doling out regular rations of lime juice during long sea forays (hence the slang term 'limeys' for British sailors), a practice that was highly successful in preventing the disease. Scurvy is characterized by general lethargy, anemia, pain in the joints and muscles, impaired wound healing, gum disease, and skin hemorrhages. Those who have it are impaired by weakness, aches and pains everywhere, and the loosening of teeth in their gums. The disease is quickly cured by dosing with vitamin C and easily prevented the same way. The legendary student who comes down with scurvy is said to have attended various institutes of higher learning, and is sometimes described as a grad student. But the greatest variation to be found in the tale is in the diet that supposedly was the young man's undoing — different versions have the hapless grind dining solely upon:  The legend makes different points depending on how it's told. The porridge, ramen, and pasta versions present a woeful tale of a student who is forced by his poverty to restrict himself to one or two inexpensive foodstuffs which, though cheap, are nutritionally lacking. He contracts scurvy out of his inability to buy good food, his pursuit of knowledge thus bringing him to harm. Such versions underscore the privations of the scholastic life and are displayed by other (presumably better fed) collegians as examples of the hardships of student life. In contrast, the hot dogs, potato chips, and pork pies versions deliver a just deserts message of an immature student acting in a hedonistically short-sighted manner, then having to pay the price for his folly. Such stories attempt to teach through example the necessity of the student's taking responsibility for his health when out from under parental constraint. Of course it is expected young people living away from home for the first time will go to bed later and eat less well than they did at home (mounted beggars race their steeds, after all), but the lesson here is to not take the kicking over of the traces too far lest dire consequences result. Surprisingly, a version one would expect to see does not surface: the fad diet. Search as we might, we've yet to encounter a telling in which a foolhardy diet regimen adopted by someone looking to drop pounds in a hurry causes him to develop scurvy. Given the proliferation of exotic weight loss schemes and the importance society places on thinness, this lack comes as a bit of a shock. Do we therefore perceive weight conscious students as being more nutritionally knowledgeable or common-sensical than their impoverished or immature counterparts? There have been real cases of scurvy in students brought on by their poor eating habits, but they occur far less frequently than the various tellings of the legend would have it. This is a legend that has traveled far beyond its occurrence, but real instances there have been — even if the \"porridge only\" aspect of the legend is missing from them. In 1967 a medical journal published an article on the sorry case of a 27-year-old Nigerian student living in London who came down with scurvy because he hadn't been eating fruit or fresh vegetables, and in 2003 Reuters reported on an unnamed student who had developed scurvy \"even though he was eating plenty of calories and had no deficiencies in most other vitamins and minerals. The student confessed to doctors that he ate no fruit and vegetables, consuming only a few types of foods — namely, cheese, crackers, soda, cookies, chocolate and water.\" Scurvy is an illness that, though it belongs to another time, is still very much with us today even in affluent countries. It is more usually found among the elderly (who may be forgetting to eat right or whose fixed incomes restrict them to a limited diet) and alcoholics (who both forget to take care of mundane bodily needs like eating in their pursuit of demon rum and whose every cent goes towards liquor purchases). But it is also on the rise among the poor of well-off societies. The impoverished often stick to bad, unvaried diets deficient in vitamins, choosing convenience and ease of preparation over good food value. (It is possible to eat well on very little money, but doing so involves cooking dishes from scratch rather than from a mix or out of a box, a practice that is far more labor intensive and skill dependent.) This poverty apparently extends to those attending university, according to the National Union of Students in Scotland, who in 1996 said student medical services had detected instances of malnutrition among undergraduates. In similar vein, a 1998 report from a university in the United States found that a significant number of students evidenced dangerously low levels of vitamin C. Does this mean legions of college students are dragging their scurvy-riddled bodies to class each day? Oh, probably not. Though malnutrition and even vitamin C deficiency might be occurring often enough to be noted on campus, it takes a person twenty to forty days without vitamin C to develop scurvy. Remember, even very small amounts of ascorbic acid prevent this disease, and as well as the obvious citrus fruit sources (oranges, lemons, limes, grapefruits), this key vitamin is found in a number of other fruits and vegetables such as strawberries, cantaloupes, papayas, raspberries, kiwi fruits, tomatoes, watermelons, green peppers, cabbage, cauliflower, spinach, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and potatoes. A serving of any one of these will generally provide the recommended minimum dietary allowance (RDA) of 60 mg a day of vitamin C for an adult, but as little as a daily dose of 5-7 mg will prevent scurvy. Therefore, even a mere tomato slice a day should be enough to fend off this ailment or, for those really pinching the pennies, a quarter of a cup of cooked potatoes.

"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/texas-chainsaw-massacre/" "mostly false" "A remake of 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' was promoted with the tagline, \"Inspired by a true story,\" prompting fans to wonder about the origin of this horror classic." "David Mikkelson" 2003-10-15 "The film The Texas Chainsaw Massacre was based on a true story." "<span class=\"copyright_text_color\"><b>Status:</b></span> &nbsp; <span style=\"color: #ff0000; font-family: Arial;\"><b><i>Sort of.</i></b></span>
When The Texas Chain Saw Massacre hit movie theaters in 1974, it quickly supplanted the previous year's top horror flick, The Exorcist, as \"the most terrifying movie ever made.\" Unlike The Exorcist, however, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre eschewed standard production values and modern special effects in favor of a grainy documentary-like approach with decidedly low-tech visual effects. The tale of five young students who unwittingly meet up with a sinister hitchhiker and the mask-wearing maniac Leatherface (whose mask is actually made from dried human skin, not leather), The Texas Chainsaw Massacre turned \"a lumberjack's tool into the stuff of nightmares and the blood-curdling scream into an art form,\" in the words of Toronto Star writer Melissa Aronzyk. The 2003 remake of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre has been touted with the tagline \"Inspired by a true story,\" leading many horror fans to wonder whether the grisly film was actually based on real events, or whether the claim is simply another bit of Hollywood promotion intended to attract filmgoers via the extra-chilling lure of a macabre tale not entirely the product of a screenwriter's imagination (a technique successfully used by the Coen brothers to entice viewers into suspending disbelief for 1996's Fargo, their gruesome cinematic depiction of a kidnapping-for-hire scheme gone awry). Actually, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre has been promoted as being \"based on a true incident\" for quite a few years now, as the original videocassette cover includes the following synopsis: The film is an account of a tragedy which befell a group of five youths, in particular Sally Hardesty. For them an idyllic summer afternoon drive became a nightmare when they were exposed to an insane and macabre family of chain saw killers. One by one they disappear to be brutally butchered, each murder more horrendous than the last with one victim being hung live on a meat hook, another trapped in his wheelchair as he is hacked to death and the surviving member of the group making a frantic bid for escape in the horrific climax.This video cassette is based on a true incident and is definitely not for the squeamish or the nervous. So, true story or not? Certainly there was no real family of cannibalistic chainsaw murderers slaughtering people in Texas, nor any actual series of chainsaw-related killings. Writer/director Tobe Hooper said the inspiration for the film came from his spotting a display of chainsaws while standing in the hardware section of a crowded store: I was in the Montgomery Ward's out in Capital Plaza. I had been working on this other story for some months — about isolation, the woods, the darkness, and the unknown. It was around holiday season, and I found myself in the Ward's hardware department, and I was still kind of percolating on this idea of isolation and such. And those big crowds have always gotten to me. There were just so many people to go through. And I was just standing there in front of an upright display of chainsaws. And the focus just racked from my eyeball to the people to the saws — and the idea popped. I said, \"Ooh, I know how I could get out of this place fast — if I just start one of these things up and make that sound.\" Of course I didn't. That was just a fantasy. Hooper has also said that he based the character of Leatherface on Ed Gein, a Wisconsin farmer who robbed graves (his own mother's supposedly among them), allegedly engaged in necrophilia and cannibalism, and murdered at least two women in the 1950s (one of whose corpses was found hanging naked — decapitated and disembowelled — in Gein's residence). As Gunnar Hansen, the actor who portrayed Leatherface, notes in his Texas Chainsaw Massacre FAQ: Here's what Tobe (director) and Kim (writer) told me themselves one night during the filming. They had heard of Ed Gein, the man in Plainfield, Wisconsin, who was arrested in the late 1950s for killing his neighbor and on whom the movie Psycho was based. So when they set out to write this movie, they decided to have a family of killers who had some of the characteristics of Gein: the skin masks, the furniture made from bones, the possibility of cannibalism. But that's all. The story itself is entirely made up. So, sorry folks. There never was a massacre in Texas on which this was based. No chainsaw either. And, in spite of those of you who have told me you remember when it happened, it really didn't happen. Really. Believe me. This is an interesting phenomenon. I've also had people tell me that they knew the original Leatherface, that they had been guards at the state prison in Huntsville, Texas, where he was a prisoner. Maybe they knew somebody who dreamed of being Leatherface. It is, I suppose, something to aspire to. Police eventually discovered the remains of 15 different mutilated female bodies in Gein's filthy farmhouse, parts of which (mostly skin and bones) had been fashioned into a variety of bizarre objects (including drums, bowls, masks, bracelets, purses, knife sheaths, leggings, chairs, lampshades, and shirts), as well as a refrigerator full of human organs. Gein later admitted to killing two women, one in 1954 and one in 1957. He was suspected of involvement in the disappearance of four other people in central Wisconsin (two men and two young girls) between 1947 and 1952, but the remains found in his farmhouse all came from adult females, and none of them matched up with any of the four missing persons. (Gein maintained that with the exception of the two women he had admitted killing, all of the body parts in his farmhouse had been taken from corpses he dug up in the local cemetery.) Gein's story inspired (at least in part) the Norman Bates character — a young man who murders women out of a twisted sense of loyalty to his dead mother — in the classic thriller Psycho, and the Buffalo Bill character — a transvestite serial killer who murders women to make use of their skin — in the horror novel Silence of the Lambs. Although the Leatherface character and the events depicted in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre differ in many substantial ways from what is known about the life and activities of Ed Gein (most notably in that Gein was apparently far more a grave robber than a murderer, and he didn't go around slicing up live victims with a chainsaw), there are definite similarities between the film and the Ed Gein story as well (e.g., hanging a murder victim's corpse in the house, making functional use of the skin from dead bodies, elements of cannibalism). Whether these similiarities are sufficiently close to justify the statement that The Texas Chainsaw Massacre was \"based on a true story\" is up to filmgoers to decide for themselves. <b>Additional Information:</b> &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/crime/caseclosed/gein.shtml\" target=\"gein1\" rel=\"noopener\"> <img src=\"https://www.snopes.com/content/themes/snopes/assets/images/common/page.gif\" alt=\"Crime Case Closed - Ed Gein\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\" align=\"ABSMIDDLE\" border=\"0\" /></a> &nbsp; <span style=\"color: #ff0000; font-family: 'Bookman Old Style', Arial; font-size: medium;\">Crime Case Closed - Ed Gein &nbsp; (<i>BBC</i>)</span> &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href=\"https://www.fortunecity.com/roswell/streiber/273/gein_cf.htm\" target=\"gein1\" rel=\"noopener\"> <img src=\"https://www.snopes.com/content/themes/snopes/assets/images/common/page.gif\" alt=\"Case File - Ed Gein\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\" align=\"ABSMIDDLE\" border=\"0\" /></a> &nbsp; <span style=\"color: #ff0000; font-family: 'Bookman Old Style', Arial; font-size: medium;\">Case File - Ed Gein</span> &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href=\"https://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/notorious/gein/bill_1.html?sect=1\" target=\"gein1\" rel=\"noopener\"> <img src=\"https://www.snopes.com/content/themes/snopes/assets/images/common/page.gif\" alt=\"Eddie Gein\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\" align=\"ABSMIDDLE\" border=\"0\" /></a> &nbsp; <span style=\"color: #ff0000; font-family: 'Bookman Old Style', Arial; font-size: medium;\">Eddie Gein &nbsp; (<i>Court TV</i>)</span> <span class=\"copyright_text_color\"><b>Last updated:</b></span> &nbsp; 14 August 2007

"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/houston-elevator-death/" "true" "We'd like to think beheadings happen only in campfire tales and low-budget thrillers, but they take place in real life too." "Barbara Mikkelson" 2003-09-13 "A Houston doctor was decapitated by a malfunctioning elevator." "All manner of sudden fatality are horrendous no matter where or when or how they occur, but we seem to assign decapitations to a special category populated by modes of death we find particularly disturbing. This form of expiration is especially gruesome because the mind is cut off from the body, ending a life, and it all takes place in a flash. A person who moments before was a living, thinking being is now just a headless trunk, spurting blood like a ghoulish prop in a bad horror film. Though all forms of demise lead to the same place, this one is sickly fascinating thanks to its elevated gore quotient and the speed with which it drives home the finality of death. We'd like to think beheadings happen only in campfire tales and low-budget thrillers, but they take place in real life too, as was the case in the death of Dr. Hitoshi Nikaidoh. On 16 August 2003, this 35-year-old surgical resident was decapitated in a freakish elevator accident at Christus St. Joseph Hospital in Houston, Texas. The accident itself is hard to imagine: the ill-fated physician was trapped between the doors of the cable-propelled elevator, then decapitated as the carriage ascended. According to the Harris County Medical Examiner's office, Nikaidoh died from multiple blunt force injuries to the head and body. His corpse was retrieved from the bottom of the elevator shaft along with two pagers, a cell phone, and an electronic organizer police believed belonged to him. The upper portion of his head, which was severed just above the lower jaw, was found in the car of the elevator. His colleague, physician's assistant Karin Steinau, who was in the car at the time, witnessed the whole thing. Ms. Steinau told police the elevator had been out of service for a few days prior to the tragedy, but at the time of the accident the \"Out of service\" sign had been removed. She had rung for the elevator (with the intent of going to the sixth floor) and had already stepped into it and pushed the button for her floor when Nikaidoh tried to get into the car as the door was closing. As soon as she saw he was trapped by the doors, Steinau tried to hit the emergency stop button but was unable to do so before the rising elevator had partially decapitated Dr. Nikaidoh. The elevator continued upwards, finally stopping between the fourth and fifth floors. Steinau was trapped in the car along with Nikaidoh's cranial remains until she was rescued by firefighters. She was treated in the hospital's emergency room for shock. The cause of the deadly accident was a mystery. Elevator doors should not shut when there is something between them, thanks to sensors mounted in the doors. Also, a set of contacts in the door should keep the elevator from moving if the doors are not closed. Yet both these things reportedly happened. A state investigative committee later reported that faulty wiring was to blame: The Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation report was done by Chief Elevator Inspector Ron Steele. Steele said an inspection of the elevator's electrical wiring diagrams found that one controller stud had two wires connected to it, although the diagram indicated it should only have one. The controller stud on which the extra wire should have been placed was empty. [Attorney Howard] Nations said the mistake bypassed safety systems that would have kept the door from closing and the elevator from ascending. \"In the course of testing and retesting the elevator [the maintenance company] had changed wiring and when they rewired it back to its original position they forgot to put this wire back where it goes,\" Nations said. The maintenance company, Kone, Inc., had been working on the elevator for four days before the incident. This month, the hospital dismissed Kone from doing its elevator maintenance. Mike Lubben, vice president of Kone, said the company still was reviewing the state report but an internal investigation concluded that a wire in an electrical panel was incorrectly connected. \"This contributed to a malfunction in the elevator doors,\" Lubben said. \"Kone is deeply saddened by this incident. We offer our deepest condolences to the family of Dr. Nikaidoh.\" Although elevator fatalities are not common, they do occur from time to time, and they are not always of the \"victim steps into an open elevator shaft\" ilk. On 21 July 2003, 76-year-old L.A. Brown was killed at the Kenner Regional Medical Center in Kenner, Louisiana, when the gurney on which he was being transported to surgery in became trapped against the roof of an elevator when the car suddenly dropped several feet just as the gurney was being pulled out of it. On 7 May 1999, 56-year-old Mary Margaret Nowosielski died in similar fashion at the St. Joseph Mercy Hospital in Michigan when the car her gurney was being rolled into suddenly went up, dragging her to the fourth floor and back down to the first floor between the car and the shaft wall. Even the elevator decapitation incident related here is not unique. On 6 January 1995, a runaway elevator in a Bronx office building decapitated 55-year-old James Chenault as he tried to help fellow passengers out of a malfunctioning car. The car had stopped slightly above the second floor and the doors opened. While Chenault was holding the doors open with his back and helping a woman whose foot had become trapped, the car lurched suddenly upward, beheading him. The victim's body fell to the bottom of the shaft, but the head remained in the car along with the remaining passengers as it shot up to the ninth floor." 2003 "Sep" 9 1990

Example: [Collected on the Internet, 2003]  Be on the lookout for this bug... Here is a safety related tid bit that I discovered because of my dog. This could be useful for those of us and our families outside. On Monday night my dog sniffed at a rather large bug (about 3 inches long) that was on our garage wall and immediately reeled back. I checked her over and saw nothing wrong — she was just pawing at her nose a little then seemed normal. Tuesday morning when I woke up she had an eye swollen shut. I irrigated it with saline and took her to the vet — she had a chemical burn on her cornea. She is getting treatment and making good progress to, hopefully, complete recovery. I photographed the bug and sent pictures to Texas A & M Entomology department — the bug is Anisomorpha monstrosa, a breed of walking stick insect imported from Belize and becoming common on the Gulf coast. This is not the normal walking stick most people are familiar with (if you are familiar with them). The female is from two to four inches long and heavy bodied. It ranges from weathered gray to shiny black in color with a distinctive pattern on its back in yellow or dull orange. This insect has a pair of meta-thoracic defense glands which can spray an irritating secretion towards \"attacking\" objects. Temporary blindness has been recorded when the secretion contacts eyes. If washed out promptly with sterile saline this poses no real hazard. If not promptly removed a chemical burn of the cornea can occur. Here is a quote from a commercial fruit grower in Florida sent to me by the entomologist: \"I went out to pick blueberries yesterday and found the bushes loaded with walking stick insects. As I picked I took to having sneezing fits. I then noticed that an unusual scent as the sneezing fit came over me. I wondered what the source of the substance could be, as I continued picking I glimpsed wisps of a yellowish color appearing in the air as the scent occurred. Then a walking stick jumped onto my hat just above my right eye, it let me have a face full of it's defense secretion & I thought that I had been sprayed with mace!\" Another reported in the gulf coast is Anisomorpha buprestoides — same capabilities. They can actually spray this chemical defense spray about 10 to 12 inches! It is recommended that you rinse any sprayed area with water as the chemical is water soluble. Again, these are not the normal thin green or brown walking sticks you are familiar with — here are photos. The first two are the harmful imports (the one labeled nasty is what got my dog) the last is the not so bad Texas native. After checking my yard I found three more of these and killed them they are an undesirable import and the A & M guy said if you see them kill them — he actually recommended dropping them in boiling hot water to kill the eggs the female carries inside as well. These are getting more and more common on the gulf coast — watch out for these and don't let your kids near them. Just when you thought killer bees were bad enough.    Origins: There are a couple of issues to tackle here: 1. Does the above message describe an encounter with Anisomorpha monstrosa, a species of walkingstick native to Belize? According to the Entomology department at Texas A & M University, Dr. John Jackman, an Extension Entomology Specialist, says that a native species of walking stick, Anisomorpha buprestoides, has likely been mistaken for a foreign species, as there \"are no confirmed instances of any foreign species of walkingstick in Texas.\" 2. Do walkingsticks spray a compound that can be harmful to one's eyes? Either species of walkingstick mentioned here (Anisomorpha monstrosa or Anisomorpha buprestoides) can spray an acidic compound from glands on the back of its thorax which is capable of causing extreme discomfort should it land in the eyes of a person or other animal, although we have not located any cases where such an occurrence resulted in permanent blindness. As with most bugs that do not pose an immediate threat, the best advice is generally to just leave them alone — if you don't bother them, they won't bother you. Pets are another matter, of course, because they aren't so easily taught what to avoid. Just about any pet allowed to roam outside freely will encounter a variety of bugs (e.g., bees, wasps, ants, spiders) that could potentially cause them discomfort or injury through biting, stinging, or other defensive means, and even the most dedicated of pet owners can't kill off every bug that might harm their animals. About the best pet owners can do is to hope their pets learn through experience which bugs to leave alone, and try to be alert to the first signs of discomfort in their pets so that any serious bites or stings are treated as quickly as possible.

"David Mikkelson" 2003-09-05 "A construction worker survived an accident that poked an 18-inch-long drill bit through one eye and out the side of his skull." "Claim: A construction worker survived an accident that poked an 18-inch-long drill bit through one eye and out the side of his skull. Status: True. Origins: Although we dread the gory industrial accidents that leave their victims dead or result in the loss of a limb (or more), other types of on-the-job injuries can strike us as far more horrific. One such accident took place on 15 August 2003, when Ron Hunt, a Truckee, California, construction worker, landed face-first on a large drill bit. Hunt was working in the Tahoe Donner Subdivision in Truckee, standing atop a six-foot ladder while drilling over his head, when he gave the drill an extra push to bore a hole. As he felt the ladder begin to wobble out from under him, he tried tossing his power drill aside (a standard practice in the construction industry, intended to prevent workers from injuring themselves attempting to regain grips on out-of-control power tools) before falling to the ground. Unfortunately, he wasn't able to throw the drill far enough away, and he landed upon it face-first. The 18-inch-long, 1.5-inch diameter chip auger drill bit pierced Hunt's right eye and exited through the side of his skull. As Hunt described the mishap: By the time I was falling, and I let the drill go down, I was already on top of it. The drill was facing up but it was off. When the drill hit, it just exploded my eye. It skewered me. I ran my hands up the drill bit, up to my eye, and put my other hand in the back of my head and felt it coming through the back of my head, and that's where pretty much the shock set in. The first thing I thought was 'Am I going to die?' I knew it was serious. I was scared. I didn't know if it was in my brain or not. The only other worker on the site that morning, Forrest Keating, heard Hunt call for help and rushed to assist him: The first thing I saw was this drill sticking out about 6 inches from the back of his head and 6 inches out the front. It was a trip, like something out of a horror movie. I was amazed he was still alive. Keating removed his shirt and attempted to stem the flow of blood gushing from Hunt's eye by wrapping the shirt around the drill. He then ran  300 yards to a nearby house to summon medical help, and when paramedics arrived they released the body of the drill from the bit and loaded Hunt onto a gurney. Hunt (conscious throughout his ordeal) was then flown by helicopter to Washoe Medical Center in Reno, Nevada, where doctors pondered their options for treating the bizarre injury. Miraculously, although the drill bit tunneled between Hunt's scalp and his skull as it came out of the side of his head, it pushed his brain aside rather than pushing into it, sparing him from death, brain damage, or paralysis. Dr. Paul Ludlow, an ear, nose and throat specialist who was the facial trauma physician on call that morning, initially intended to cut off the drill bit but eventually decided that the best approach was to, in effect, unscrew it from Hunt's head: We had to either cut down on it, which meant making a rather long incision through a lot of muscle, or just unscrew it - twist it all the way through and out. We would have cut it off, but after a few minutes of drilling, we noticed that it was loose. And so we just put down our blade and twisted the bit. Hunt had sufficiently recovered from his injuries by early September to appear on national television programs such as CNN News and ABC's \"Good Morning America.\" Although he was truly fortunate not to have suffered more severe injuries (or damage to his motor or speech skills), he came away from the accident far from unscathed: besides suffering a fractured skull (which required a second operation to insert two titanium plates to reinforce the fractured bone), he lost an eye and now faces hundreds of thousands of dollars in medical bills and rehabilitation costs. According to news accounts, Hunt is not covered by state compensation for on-the-job injuries, and he was a self-employed worker with no medical insurance. Injuries of this type always call to mind the case of Phineas Gage, who in 1848 survived an accident which blew a 3-foot, 7-inch tamping iron under a cheek bone and completely out through the top of his head. Although Gage lived on for almost another dozen years, he suffered dramatic changes in personality and was subject to epileptic seizures in his final months. Last updated: 14 July 2006

"Barbara Mikkelson" 2003-08-22 "A tourist was electrocuted while crossing a street in Las Vegas." "Claim: A tourist was electrocuted while crossing a street in Las Vegas. Status: True. Origins: Las Vegas, Nevada, is a desert town, hot and dry. Daytime temperatures in July and August are in the hundreds, sometimes climbing to the hundred-and-teens. Rain, when it does come, often arrives in torrents that quickly build to flash-flood proportions. On Saturday, 16 August 2003, a 39-year-old mother of four met the Grim Reaper while doing nothing more remarkable than crossing Las Vegas Boulevard, the famed \"Las Vegas Strip\" of the travelogues. Yet it was not a car that brought about Rebecca \"Becky\" Longhoffer's demise — she was electrocuted in mid-stride when she stepped on a cast iron plate on a traffic island. The plate, which
covered electrical wiring feeding traffic signals, had been soaked by a heavy downpour and was obscured by a puddle several inches deep, residue of a recent unexpected storm which swept the area. Officials suspect that a combination of frayed wiring, dampness from the sudden storm, and open-toed shoes worn by the victim combined to deliver the electric shock that snatched a life without warning. The box that delivered the fatal charge had not been inspected since it was installed in late 1995 or early 1996; over the years thousands of pedestrians have walked across that wiring box, and the tread of many shoes on the plate may have worn down the insulation of the wires concealed therein to the point of dangerous exposure. Clark County officials estimate Las Vegas has about 16,000 of the same type of traffic signal boxes. They announced they would begin inspecting the other boxes on the Las Vegas Strip within the next few weeks. Ms. Longhoffer was making her first trip to Las Vegas, accompanying her fiancé who was participating in a billiards tournament. Moments before she died, she had been talking to her brother on her cell phone. She left behind four children, ages 22, 15, 12, and 13 months.

"David Mikkelson" 2003-07-27 "John Howard Griffin, the author of Black Like Me, died from skin cancer caused by the treatment he underwent to darken his skin." "Claim: John Howard Griffin, the author of Black Like Me, died from skin cancer caused by the treatment he underwent to darken his skin. FALSE  Origins: John Howard Griffin was born in Dallas, Texas, in 1920 but left the United States for France at age fifteen in pursuit of a classical education. While barely out of his teens, he had completed studies in such diverse fields as French, literature, medicine, and music, worked as an intern conducting experiments in the use of music as therapy for the  criminally insane, specialized in medieval music under the Benedictines at the Abbey of Solesmes, and was contemplating making the religious life his vocation. He wrote about his experiences at the Abbey and the personal struggles he underwent during this period of his life in his 1952 book, The Devil Rides Outside. The outbreak of World War II intruded upon Griffin's plans; he responded to the challenge by calling upon his medical training to serve as a medic in France before spending three years with the U.S. Army Air Corps in the South Seas (where he was decorated for bravery). During Griffin's military service a head injury caused by an exploding shell caused his eyesight to deteriorate to the point that he eventually went completely blind. Nonetheless, he continued writing and turned out several novels before his eyesight miraculously returned in 1957; he later chronicled this dark period of his life in an unpublished work entitled Scattered Shadows. Griffin's best-known struggle against adversity, however was a self-imposed one: In 1959, after shaving his head and using drugs and ultraviolet light to darken his skin, Griffin spent six weeks traveling through the states of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Georgia posing as an itinerant black man in order to record a first-hand account of the virulent racism still prevalent in the Deep South. Griffin's account of his experiences, published as the book Black Like Me in 1961, is a gripping tale of degradation and cruelty, an account of a man who becomes the target of rudeness, indignities, insults, racial slurs, and violent threats, and is denied the basic necessities of life (a place to live, gainful employment, transportation, even the use of restrooms) simply because his skin is dark. Particularly revealing experiences came at the end of Griffin's investigation when he switched back and forth between his black and white identities and observed the negative reactions he received from people (both black and white) who had treated him kindly just days, or even hours, earlier: Black Like Me disabused the idea that minorities were acting out of paranoia,” says Gerald Early, a black scholar at Washington University. “There was this idea that black people said certain things about racism, and one rather expected them to say these things. Griffin revealed that what they were saying was true. It took someone from outside coming in to do that. And what he went through gave the book a remarkable sincerity.” Even well before Griffin's actual death in 1980, rumors had begun circulating that he had died as a direct result of his Black Like Me experiment — the treatments he undertook to darken his skin, people whispered, had led to his contracting an ultimately fatal case of skin cancer: Since many people deeply resented Griffin's book and the racial tensions it exposed — he and his family moved to Mexico for a time after he was hanged in effigy in his hometown of Mansfield, Texas — the [cancer] rumor has an element of the sinister to it, a satisfied wish for revenge. Since many people who told the story had no quarrel with Griffin or his discoveries, the rumor doubled as a sort of ironic tragedy, showing that those who do good are not exempt from life's cruelties.1 The rumors had no substance, however. Although Griffin's transformation did involve his submitting to medical treatments which posed potential health risks, he was carefully monitored by his doctor and suffered nothing more serious or lasting than temporary, relatively minor side effects: Under the direction of a New Orleans dermatologist, Griffin had taken medication orally and had exposed his entire body to the ultraviolet rays of a sun lamp. For about a week, up to fifteen hours each day, he had stretched out on a couch under the glare of the lamp. His eyes had been protected by cotton pads when he faced the lamp, and he had worn sunglasses when turned away from its rays. The doctor had prescribed Oxsoralen — a drug used to treat vitiligo, a cutaneous infection most common among but not exclusive to black people, which produces white splotches on the skin. Typically the medication is given over a period of six to twelve weeks. However, Griffin's experiment necessitated an accelerated pace. By taking larger than normal doses of the drug along with extended exposure under the lamp, the slow darkening process was intensified. Despite the serious health hazards, the doctor agreed to the acceleration but monitored the experiment with regular blood tests that charted any damage to the liver. None of the blood tests indicated liver damage from the Oxsoralen and, except for lassitude and extreme nausea, Griffin experienced no lasting ill-effects.2 The doctor had prescribed Oxsoralen — a drug used to treat vitiligo, a cutaneous infection most common among but not exclusive to black people, which produces white splotches on the skin.

 Griffin did not die of skin cancer, nor did he die from any malady related to his Black Like Me experiment. He was in poor health for much of his adult life, not only because of the head injury he suffered in World War II but also from spinal malaria (which left him paralyzed for a time), diabetes, and osteomyelitis (an acute and chronic bone infection). Griffin's health took a serious turn for the worse when he suffered a severe heart attack while on an extended lecture tour in late 1976, yet he lived for another four years, enduring several more heart attacks and surgeries before passing away at age 60 from diabetes-related complications on 9 September 1980.

"David Mikkelson" 2003-07-26 "An Indian boy experienced a rare condition in which beetles bred in his body and emerged from his groin as full-grown flies." "Claim: An Indian boy experienced a rare condition in which beetles bred in his body and emerged from his groin as full-grown flies. Status: Undetermined. Example: [The Calcutta Telegraph, 2003]  Admitted in Burdwan Medical College Hospital since last Saturday, Chandan Goswami stunned doctors as the flies began to come out of a part of his crotch to take wing. Some of the flies were caught by the boy’s parents. \"This is a condition called myiasis in which a human or animal body, dead or alive, is invaded by the larvae of particular types of flies,\" said an excited Snehansu Pan, the surgeon taking care of Chandan. [Rest of article here]
 Origins: Urban legendry is rife with horror tales of insects entering, living in, breeding in, and emerging from the bodies of living human beings. Although nearly all such stories are apocryphal cautionary tales, in mid-June 2003 news accounts began to emerge from India chronicling the plight  of a Chandan Goswami, a 13-year-old Bengali boy believed to be suffering from myiasis, a rare condition described as one in which: The larvae of a type of fly invade a human or animal body, dead or alive. The deposited eggs then enter the body through pores, the mucous membrane or even the mouth. The hatched larvae then emerge out the host's skin and pupate. In Chandan's case, whole flies (later identified as a species of the rove beetle) complete with wings were emerging from his groin and flying off. Most readers became aware of this story through articles from the Indo-Asian News Service and the Calcutta Telegraph which were redistributed through Yahoo!'s on-line news service. Usually odd news reports emanating from a place such as India are suspect and difficult to verify, but in this case the Calcutta Telegraph provided day-by-day news coverage with a wealth of detailed information for several days running. The last article, dated 25 June, reported that Chandan's parents, frustrated with his doctors' inabilities to adequately diagnose or treat his malady, had gotten him discharged from Burdwan Medical College Hospital so that he could be admitted to the urology department at SSKM Hospital: Parents of Chandan Goswami, the boy suffering from myiasis, today got him discharged from the medical college hospital here and set off for Calcutta to admit him to the urology department of SSKM hospital. Faced with pressure from Chandan's family, who alleged that the doctors could not do anything even after keeping the 13-year-old under observation and treatment for 18 days, the seven-member medical board met this morning and released him. Since Chandan’s admission on June 7, 13 insects, resembling flies but still unidentified, have flown out of the perforation in the boy’s crotch on four occasions. The doctors performed several clinical examinations, including a cystoscopy, which yielded no result. Tamal Ghosh, Chandan's uncle accompanying the family to Calcutta, said the hospital had handed over only the discharge certificate. They have not got the papers relating to the treatment he received and the tests done on him. It seems Chandan left the hospital with bitter memories. \"Last night one of the doctors told me my son had gone mad. He asked us to take him away and chastised me for wasting their time,\" said Alpana, Chandan's mother. Ghosh said the doctors were not taking proper care of the boy, who lay writhing in pain last night. Chandan suffered an internal injury during the cystoscopy and has been passing blood with his urine. But doctors said such injuries were not uncommon during the procedure.

 The outcome of this story is still murky, though. According to a New India Press account of 25 July 2003, after Chandan was shifted to the SSKM Hospital, \"doctors declared that it could be a stray case of flies coming from an external source and falling in while the boy was urinating.\" We haven't turned up any follow-up articles on Chandan's condition since then, although we have noted a mini-outbreak of news reports from India about patients purportedly suffering from similar afflictions. For example, the day after the last article on Chandan, the Calcutta Telegraph published another account of a boy suffering from a similar condition in which dung beetles were emerging from his rectum: Live \"dung\" beetles today emerged out of a perforation in the lower part of the body of a two-and-half-year-old boy in a rare condition known to be occurring in tropical countries. Experts termed the disease a rare case of \"scarabiasis or canthariasis\", prevalent among children between two and five years. Sources said the boy, a resident of Hakimpara, was being treated by paediatrician S.B. Mantry for lack of appetite, abdominal cramps and weakness. Last week, the boy's parents had showed Mantry a black insect which, according to them, had come out while he was defecating. They told the doctor such insects had buzzed out earlier, only this time they caught it before it could take wings. Mantry was reportedly taken aback when he was shown the beetle-like insect, which had bright yellow stripes on its black body. The doctor advised the boy's parents to have the specimen examined by Supada Mallick, a local pathologist. A surprised Mallick referred the case to another pathologist, S.K. Roy, last Saturday. Roy described the disease as scarabiasis, better known as the \"beetle disease.\" He confirmed that the insect that had come out of the child’s body was a beetle. \"Medical parasitology terms this disease as scarabiasis or canthariasis, where beetles infest the digestive tract,\" Roy said.

 On 25 July 2003, the New India Press published a column on a boy allegedly hospitalized (at the very same Burdwan facility where Chandan had initially been treated) because ants were crawling out of his eye: After the baffling case of the boy who passed live flies while urinating, an eleven year old was on Thursday admitted to a government hospital for investigation why black ants were crawling out of his left eye since last week. A resident of Tahala village of Birbhum district, Abu Bakkar, a farmer's son, was first taken to the district headquarters hospital at Suri with his bizarre complaint, from where he was referred to the Burdwan Medical College and Hospital here. The left eye of the boy was swollen and had a reddish appearance. Black ants were emerging at regular intervals, hospital sources said. He would be kept under observation for two days, the sources said.

"Claim: A child died during a routine operation because someone used a cell phone in a hospital. Status: False. Examples:  A 4 year old girl was admitted due to leg fracture. As it was an open fracture, she had to undergo an operation to stitch the protruding bone back in place. Though it was quite a minor operation, still she was hooked on to a life system, as it's somehow part of the process. The doctors had to input some data prior to the operation to suit different conditions. Thereafter,the operation proceeded. Half way through the process, the life support system suddenly went dead. The culprit: Some idiot was using his/her hand-phone outside the operation theatre. And the frequency had affected the system. They tried to track the fellow but to no avail. The little girl, young and innocent as she was, died soon after. Sad to say, she was the only child. Message: Be compassionate! Do not use your hand phone at any hospital or places where you are told not to use it. You might not be caught in the act, but you might have killed someone without knowing. Please pass this to as many, since most of us are just not aware of the seriousness.
 
 [Collected via e-mail, August 2008] An 6 year old girl was admitted to a hospital for a leg fracture. As it turned out, it was an open fracture, and she had to have an operation to fix it. As small as it was, she was hooked on a life support system (part
of the process) and just before the doctors were done, she mysteriously flatlined. The doctors were desperately trying to revive her, and a male doctor rushed out to get something (not specified) and he noticed a woman talking on a cell phone outside of the room. He came back with the item and found out there was nothing that could be done. He went out and snatched the phone from the woman, and smashed it to bits on the floor. The woman was angry, yelling at him to pay for a new phone, but the doctor ignored her, having to notify the parents. A week after the girl's funeral, she heard a knock on her door, and when she opened the door, 2 police officers told her to appear in court a month later. When she appeared in court, she was convicted guilty of involuntary manslaughter, and was told to pay the family thousands of dollars. She ran out of money to rent her apartment, and was evicted, the repo men took her stuff, and she lost her job. She became depressed, and one day, committed suicide. The moral of the story: Don't use cell phones near hospital equipment. Turn them off, or don't bring them.
 Origins: We first saw this forward in 1998, but those who are easily horrified should take heart — we've yet to find any news report or medical journal article or FDA-tracked case detailing a death caused by use of a cell phone in a hospital or other medical facility, let alone one of a four-year-old child undergoing a minor operation. This item is a cautionary tale meant to drive home the importance of turning off wireless phones around medical equipment. The story is told the way it is (a small child dying during a minor procedure, rather than an adult passing away during a risky operation) to underscore the tragedy such a thoughtlessly-caused death would be. Just as parents intent upon teaching youngsters to keep hands and heads inside school buses pass along tales of little girls beheaded by road signs, so gruesome exaggeration features in this legend told to make a point about the possible deadly consequences of a seemingly innocuous activity. Although no real deaths have yet occurred, enough scary incidents have been attributed to cell phones that at least some hospitals have banned the use of those devices on their premises, or at least in their trauma, critical care, and surgical areas. Cell phone interference has supposedly created false alarms in infant incubators, prompted heart monitors to spew false results (making it appear as if patients hooked up to them were in cardiac arrest), set off fire alarms, caused IV pumps to stop working, and contributed to failures in equipment necessary for the maintenance of life itself. (For instance, at Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas, a breathing machine for infants reportedly sputtered to a halt when a worker switched on a cellular telephone while medical equipment was being tested, although no baby was attached to the device at the time.) Another incident reported on the FDA web site noted: A patient in the intensive care unit was receiving epinephrine by an infusion pump when a visitor received a cell phone call. When the phone was answered, the infusion pump increased the rate of the drip. The patient received an unintended bolus of medication and subsequently developed epinephrine toxicity. Yet it's not clear what the threat level actually is. In March 2007, Mayo Clinic researchers published the results of a study in which they attempted to deliberately create interference in medical devices through the use of cell phones: Researchers at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., decided to find out what would happen if they used a cellphone close to some 200 different medical devices. In the first half of [2006], they used two different models of Nokia phone to perform tests in 75 patient rooms at their facility. They also tested two BlackBerry models. The paper published in the March [2007] issue of the Mayo Clinic Proceedings says there was no \"clinically important interference\" when cellphones were used in a \"normal\" way. Although some medical care facilities have enacted bans on cell phone usage, others have merely chosen to restrict their use to non-critical parts of the hospital, and some have decided to ignore the whole thing. Patients and visitors will not find consistent policies in place in all hospitals and have to rely on signage on the premises (or lack thereof) to guide them as to what each facility's cell phone policy is. As for how seriously those hospitals who have chosen to institute bans on cell phone use within their walls take matters, in 1998 a man in Wareham, Massachusetts, was arrested in the emergency room of Tobey Hospital after refusing to end his call. Officers twice used pepper spray on him in an effort to relieve him of his phone. Barbara \"assault and peppered\" Mikkelson Additional information:    Last updated: 16 August 2008

"Barbara Mikkelson" 2003-07-01 "The death of an infant in an automobile accident led to the invention of 'Baby on Board' signs." "Claim: The death of an infant in an automobile accident led to the invention of 'Baby on Board' signs. FALSE Examples:  I think it is about time people realised the origin of all those ridiculous \"baby on board\" signs (and such inevitable copy-cat idiocies as \"mother-in-law in boot\" and \"rottweiler on board\"). There was a tragic start to those signs. Some years ago, there was a car crash in Canada. The police located adult and child members of a family trapped in the crashed car, rescued them and sent them to hospital to recover. The car was towed to an impounding yard, and the following day police discovered a baby's body frozen to death but otherwise uninjured under one of the seats. A campaign was then started in Canada to alert rescuers to the fact that there was a \"baby on board\", which needed to be located in the event of a crash. If a baby is not on board, the sign is removed.
 
 [Collected on the Internet, 2003] Years ago, I heard a story about WHY the signs were created but only once, and I wonder if it is true. The story was that a serious car accident occurred and an unconscious woman was removed from the vehicle. The front of the car was badly damaged and it wasn't until later (vague time frame) that a car seat with a dead infant was discovered under the front dash of the passenger side.

 Origins: In the early 1980s, the highways and byways of North America became the showcase for America's latest pet rock, the \"Baby on Board\" sign. The five-inch,  black-on-yellow diamond-shaped signs which became an overnight sensation were usually placed in corners of vehicles' rear windshields with suction cups.
Unlike what is implied in the gruesome folklore that has come to be associated with these advisories, their purpose was not to alert rescue workers to the presence of babies at accident scenes; they were instead supplications to other drivers to exercise additional care, reminders that they shared the road with vehicles carrying children. Though the backstory about an infant who died in a car crash because he wasn't found in time is one that would chill any parent's blood, how these signs came to be is far removed from the lore. There were no dead babies, no horrific crashes. In 1984, Michael Lerner founded Safety 1st for the purpose of manufacturing \"Baby on Board\" signs. The inspiration for the signs came not from a deadly accident that took the life of a youngster but from a friend who saw similar stickers in Europe. Mr. Lerner himself was occasionally worked into the rumor — some versions asserted this childless bachelor had first developed the ''Baby on Board!'' idea after losing a son or a daughter in an accident. From its humble beginnings, Safety 1st went on to become a juvenile products marketer with a lineup that included teething rings, potty chairs, and electronic baby monitors — 650 items at all. The company went public in 1993, then was bought by Dorel Industries Inc., its Canadian rival, for
$195 million in 2000. Because few situations or admonitions are deemed so serious that they rule out all opportunity for humor, straightforward \"there's a child in the car, so drive carefully\" requests quickly spawned a number of parodies, including \"Baby Driving,\" \"Warning: Baby is Closer Than it Appears,\" and the ever-popular \"Baby Carries No Cash.\" It wasn't long before some communities were attempting to bar these parody signs, stating their presence took away from the message conveyed in the original and worked to desensitize drivers to what was meant as a safety measure. Michael Lerner was similarly displeased by the parodies because he believed they mocked a serious effort to achieve safer roads. ''Our concept was to really improve driver awareness of child safety,'' he said. ''Car accidents are the number one cause of child deaths in the United States.'' In 1986 a study conducted by a Bronx assemblyman's office found humorous plays on the \"Baby on Board\" sign outnumbered the real thing by five to one.

"Barbara Mikkelson" 2003-04-03 "A coed fatally skewers herself while masturbating with a broom handle." "Claim: A coed fatally skewers herself while masturbating with a broom handle. LEGEND Examples:  A story that I heard that was kind of like the hot dog one was that there was this girl who got drunk at a party then she went home and she was really horny so she used a broom stick to pleasure herself. She was standing on the table for some reason and her mom walked in on her. She jumped off the table and the broomstick went up her and it killed her. I doubt this is true but this girl just told me that.
 
 [Collected via e-mail, 1999] I heard something close to your frozen hotdog story. But it was about an athletic girl, who was doing arm pull ups. And after awhile she started to get horny from the up and down motion. So she found a broom and started to do her pull ups again, with the broom inside of her. After awhile her mom comes in to tell her that dinner is ready, but she walks in while the girl is masterbating with the broom. The mom screams and scares the girl, that she forgets the broom is underneathe her and she lets go of the bar. Then the broom goes through all of her organs, and comes out of her mouth and ends up killing the girl.
 
 [Collected via e-mail, 1999] A teenager reportedly was experimenting in her ways of masturbation. Her mother was rarely away from the house, so she had not come across too many opportunities to masturbate, but one day her mother came home from work, worn out, and told her that she was going to draw herself a bubble bath and not to expect her for at least an hour. The teenage girl took advantage of this time slot and decided to experiment with rubbing herself with various objects, and one of them was a broom. Finding she could not \"do much\" with the broom in her bed, she moved into the kitchen and situated herself on top of the refrigerator. Apparently her mother surprised her by opening the bathroom door before the hour was up, and the girl, not wanting her mother to find her in this compromising position, hurriedly hopped off of the refrigerator, without removing the broom handle. The broom handle was shoved up inside of her and came out her eye.
 
 [Collected via e-mail, 1999] My friend's dad was the director of one of our local hospitals. One day after coming home from work he told his son about something that had happened that day (even though it was supposedly confidential). He said a gay male had been admitted to the hospital that day. The problem was the guy, trying to get off, rigged up this sex toy type thing. It supposedly consisted of several pulleys attached to the ceiling and a broom, which was inserted into the rectum. The idea was when the guy, who was suspended from the ceiling or something, pulled on one rope the broom would pleasure him. But then something went terribly wrong and it broke sending the broom up the rectum and through his stomach. Later family or friends found him (embarrassing I'm sure) hanging there with a broom up his butt.
 Variations:
     our readers to ask about a related tale of masturbatory misadventure involving a broom. Though we cannot pinpoint how long this particular urban legend has been circulating, it has clearly been part of the genre for many a year. Akin to other tales of parental discovery of masturbation (e.g. one we call the Tea-Bird in the Hand), it's Mother, the ultimate moral figure who happens upon the scene of her child experimenting with self-gratification, never Dad. At least in the world of lore, fathers are not perceived as wielding the same power of disapproval mothers are expected to dish out, so good storytelling demands the parent deemed more easily shocked and less likely to be permissive about sexual matters be the one called upon to witness the act. Yet parental discovery there must be because mere death (even one involving being skewered on a broom handle) is not enough; Mother has to witness with her own eyes what her dearest darling was doing if the underlying moral of this cautionary tale is to be transmitted adequately. (Teens fear parental discovery far more than loss of life because the one is far more real a possibility to them.) In the broom story, the girl doing the experimenting pays for her expanded sexual knowledge and uncontrollable lust with her life. That same lust results in other deaths by impalement in another urban legend, the venerable \"girl on a gearshift\" tale, in which other young ladies overcome by sensations of sexual tension attempt to relieve them with equally fatal results. Underlying all of these stories are two shared themes: \"inappropriate sexual knowledge\" and \"uncontrollable lust,\" both seen as daunting concepts by the average teen. That sense of trepidation is put into words in these cautionary tales which warn teens (especially girls) against the dangers of letting their burgeoning sexual feelings take them over by presenting wildly improbable worst-case scenarios of what could happen if they ever did unleash that particular ravening beast.

"David Mikkelson" 2003-03-10 "Evian brand drinking water is filtered with cow's blood." "Claim: Evian brand drinking water is filtered with cow's blood. Status: False. Origins: At the height of the French-bashing that spread throughout the U.S. in February 2003 as a reaction to the two countries' disagreements over the propriety of taking military action against Iraq, a few U.S. congressmen started grumbling about implementing some symbolic economic sanctions against France. Among the items mentioned were imposing new health standards on bottled drinking water imported from <IMG HEIGHT=191 WIDTH=197 ALT=\"Wine\" TITLE=\"Wine\" SRC=\"https://www.snopes.com/uploads/images/horrors/graphics/wine.jpg\" ALIGN=RIGHT BORDER=0 HSPACE=16 VSPACE=16> France and requiring warning labels on French wines clarified with bovine's blood. These two items became jumbled in the public's mind and emerged as the claim that Evian drinking water is \"filtered with cow's blood.\" One of the actions proposed to \"punish\" France was passing legislation which would impose new and additional health standards on drinking water exported to the U.S. Such an action would obviously increase the costs to (and thereby decrease the profits of) foreign companies who market drinking water in the U.S., and France, as the largest exporter of drinking water to the United States (65 million gallons in 2001) would be hurt most of all. The association of this story with Evian is obvious: Evian is the most well-known brand of natural mineral water in the U.S., and most of the newspaper accounts of this story specifically mentioned Evian as an example of \"popular French waters.\" But \"cow's blood\" has nothing to do with Evian (or any other brand of drinking water); that association came from another aspect of the same story proposing that the U.S. slap \"bright orange warning labels\" on French wine clarified with bovine's blood. The intent of such legislation would be to frighten Americans away from buying French wines by calling their attention to a practice few of them were aware of: The underlying issue involves a wine-making trick called \"fining,\" in which a protein is mixed into wine in vats or barrels to attract colloidal materials that could make the wine cloudy or hazy. These proteins fall to the bottom of the vats and the wine is siphoned away from them; in theory, at least, none of the fining material remains in the clarified wine. Traditional fining agents include a variety of odd substances, including isinglass (made from fish bladders), egg whites and, in some parts of the Rhone Valley in France, dried oxblood or blood albumen. The mention of requiring bright orange warning labels on French wines was largely a bogus issue, as the use of bovine's blood as fining agent was already a dying practice before it was banned outright by the EEC back in 1997: These old-fashioned practices are somewhat dying out in any case; most modern wineries, including virtually all larger wineries, now pass wine through bentonite (clay) filters rather than using organic finings. Because of legitimate concerns about the epidemic of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), popularly called \"mad cow disease,\" which became epidemic among cattle in Britain during the 1990s and which has been associated with the human brain disorder Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, the European Economic Community banned the use of oxblood for wine fining in 1997.

 The intent of the proposed legislation was presumably to require warning labels on the few French wines produced using bovine's blood as a clarifier before the 1997 EEC ban went into effect, since bottled wine is typically sold for many years beyond its production date. Nothing came of these murmured proposals, although it appears that angry legislators may have achieved one of their intended results by a completely unintended route: people are now avoiding Evian because they believe it to be \"filtered with cow's blood.\" Last updated: 25 January 2007

 Origins: Though we've no clear notion <IMG WIDTH=149 HEIGHT=201 TITLE=\"Dishwasher\" ALT=\"Child and dishwasher\" TITLE=\"Knife\" SRC=\"https://www.snopes.com/uploads/images/horrors/graphics/dishwash.jpg\" BORDER=0 ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=16 VSPACE=16> who \"Mary Leigh\" or \"Bryan's family\" are or what their involvement was with this story, the gist of the message is factual: On 22 January 2003, a five-year-old Kentucky girl died of wounds received when she fell onto a knife exposed in an open dishwasher. The fatal accident befell Payton Michael McElroy during a visit at her grandparents' house in the company of her mother and brother. The two children were playing while the grandmother was unloading the dishwasher, and somehow during this play session the girl tripped and fell onto a knife housed on the open dishwasher's door. The blade punctured the child's
heart and left lung. This tragedy serves as a sad reminder for the need to always load utensils into the dishwasher with their sharp ends pointing down. Forks, knives, scissors — all should be placed in the cutlery basket with their blades or tines down. Although deaths in this manner are rare, there have been others. In 2001 a Vancouver man who collapsed from an undisclosed illness fell on sharp objects housed in an open dishwasher at his mother's home and expired of his wounds. In 1997, Mark Rockingham, a twelve-year-old British boy, died the same way Payton McElroy had — a play session ended with him falling onto a sharp knife in an open dishwasher, severing major arteries in his chest and puncturing one of his lungs. One of our readers told us about his experience, which was quite similar to those described above, though he was fortunate enough to live through it: [Collected via e-mail, 2006] When I was 6 years old (now 23) my cousin had some of my toys and wouldn't give them to me. I ran into the kitchen and hit a wet spot and slipped and fell into the dishwasher my mother was unloading. When I came up there was a knife with a blade about 7 or 8 inches long in the left side of my chest. All you could see was the handle. My mom screamed, I looked down ( I didn't even feel it) and screamed, she pulled it out and my parents took me to the emergency room. The ER doctor said that it missed my aeortic wall by less than a quarter of an inch. I am lucky to be alive today.

 Real incidents or not, the odds of a similar accident's taking the life of a child are so small that one needn't feel this is a warning that must be trumpeted as quickly and as widely as possible lest children's lives remain at risk. However, lesser injuries from up-pointed utensils can and do happen, and even adults at times manage to impale themselves on items carelessly placed in cutlery baskets as they reach in to put dishes away, so this is a true-life cautionary tale worth sharing if we're to convince our friends and family to change the way they load their dishwashers.

"Barbara Mikkelson" 2003-01-08 "Enraged father punishes 3-year-old by smashing his fingers, then commits suicide out of remorse." "Claim: Enraged father punishes 3-year-old by smashing his fingers, then commits suicide out of remorse. FALSE Examples:  It is difficult to love a person, especially when you don't know how to express your feelings. Worse still, if you are unsure of the person's feelings, the uncertainty can really tear your heart... This is a true story that happened in the States. A man came out of his home to admire his new truck. To his puzzlement, his 3-year-old son was happily hammering dents into the shiny paint. The man ran to his son, knocked him away, and hammered the little boy's hands into a pulp as punishment. When the father calmed down, he rushed his son to the hospital. Although the doctor tried desperately to save the crushed bones, he finally had to amputate the fingers from both the boy's hands. When the boy woke up from the surgery and saw his bandaged stubs, he innocently asked, \"Daddy, I'm sorry about your truck, but when are my fingers going to grow back?\" The father went home and committed suicide. Think about the story the next time you see someone spill milk at a dinner table or hear a baby crying. Think first before you lose your patience with someone you love. Trucks can be repaired. Broken bones and hurt feelings often can't. Too often we fail to recognize the difference between the person and the performance. People make mistakes. We are allowed to make mistakes. But the actions we take while in a rage will haunt us forever.
 
 [Collected on the Internet, June 2009] Used vs. Loved While a man was polishing his new car, his 4 yr old son picked up a stone and scratched lines on the side of the car. In anger, the man took the child's hand and hit it many times; not realizing he was using a wrench. At the hospital, the child lost all his fingers due to multiple fractures. When the child saw his father..... with painful eyes he asked, 'Dad when will my fingers grow back?' The man was so hurt and speechless; he went back to his car and kicked it a lot of times. Devastated by his own actions.... sitting in front of that car he looked at the scratches; the child had written 'LOVE YOU DAD'. The next day that man committed suicide.... Anger and Love have no limits; choose the latter to have a beautiful, lovely life..... Things are to be used and people are to be loved, But the problem in today's world is that, People are used and things are loved... During the day, be careful to keep this thought in mind: Things are to be used, but People are to be loved ... Be yourself.... This is the only day we HAVE. Have a nice day Watch your thoughts; they become words. Watch your words; they become actions. Watch your actions; they become habits. Watch your habits they become character; Watch your character; it becomes your destiny. I'm glad a friend forwarded this to me as a reminder.. If you don't pass this on to anybody, nothing bad will happen; if you
do, you will have ministered to someone. Have YOU become a user and do not recognize love?
Have YOU missed the opportunity to apologize for your thoughtlessness. Stay FAITHFUL and Be GRATEFUL
 Origins: This tear-jerker of a cautionary tale about a man who smashes his son's fingers in a fit of anger over a minor transgression on the child's part and then kills himself out of remorse has been circulating on the Internet since 1998, often under the title \"Crime and Punishment.\" There is no evidence supporting the claim that this incident played out in real life or that it \"is a true story that happened in the States,\" however. As usual there is little information on which to base a thorough search as the account lists no names, dates, or places; but nonetheless we searched a number of news archives and were unable to locate any news item that resembled this tale. Certainly some parents abuse their children, and in some cases the level of that abuse is horrendous; but this particular tale of a father's pounding his son's hands into pulp, the amputation of the child's fingers, and the guilt-ridden parent's killing himself is made up. This is an instructional tale meant to impart the message that parents must resist the urge to act out their anger. This sad story was an updating of an older piece of lore, one sent as an anonymous letter to the Salt Lake City, Utah, media in 1986: Currently there is a six year old little girl in primary Children's Hospital with no hands. She apparently took a hammer to the family car and to punish her father took the same hammer to her hands. By the time they got her to the hospital she had lost two fingers (they fell off) and then her blood vessels, bone and nerves were so badly damaged that they had to amputate both hands. The mother will not press charges because \"he was in charge of discipline,\" and the hospital is being forced to return this child to these two crazy people. For God's sake, can't the media do something. She apparently took a hammer to the family car and to punish her father took the same hammer to her hands. By the time they got her to the hospital she had lost two fingers (they fell off) and then her blood vessels, bone and nerves were so badly damaged that they had to amputate both hands. The mother will not press charges because \"he was in charge of discipline,\" and the hospital is being forced to return this child to these two crazy people. For God's sake, can't the media do something.
 Again, there was no such child. (The reporter to whom the letter had been sent investigated the story and found nothing to it, and of course any child so abused would have been quickly scooped up by Children's Services and removed from the family rather than being returned to \"these two crazy people\"). According to noted folklorist Jan Harold Brunvand, the 1986 story contains two typical legend motifs: legal helplessness of a wronged innocent, and alleged suppression of information by authorities. In late 2010, a similar tale about lipstick-smeared sheets was circulated via social media, with users being encouraged to post it as their Facebook status in order to deliver a message to \"stop child abuse.\" In September 2011, the story was once again circulated on Facebook, that time accompanied by a heart-wrenching photo of an injured child. A child says to his mom' \"mommy I colored your sheets with lipstick\" furious she beat her child until unconscious. Regretting what she had done, and in tears, she asked the child to \"open your eyes\" but it was too late. His little heart had stopped beating. In the bedroom the sheets ..read, \"MOMMY I LOVE YOU\". Post this as your status for an hour to deliver the message to STOP CHILD ABUSE As with the \"smashed fingers\" story, no evidence has yet to surface that there ever was such a child. While the account lists no names, dates, or places on which to base a thorough search, news archives are silent about such an incident. The heartbreaking photo of a little child sucking on a blue pacifier who has a black eye and stitches running from the inner corner of one eye up to between her brows is of Jade Wardle, who in 2002 (when she was two) was savaged by a dog her family had adopted. Both the \"smashed fingers\" and \"colored your sheets with lipstick\" tales employ the \"regret-filled parent\" encountered in other legends, such as the gold-wrapped box.

Status: False. Examples: [Collected via e-mail, 2002]  I just heard a rumor about Nickelodeon cancelling SpongeBob SquarePants because a child drown in the ocean while looking for him.
 
 My children have all heard rumors about a little boy who watched spongebob (on nickeloen), then went into the ocean to see him and drowned. They are all in 3 different schools. I also heard it from the interns at work.
 
 Following is a rumor making the kids rounds lately. My daughter - 09 yrs old, in Nassau County, NY verifies it's truth as the story was corroborated by her cousin 11 from the Boston, MA area-reports: Sponge Bob Square Pants is being cancelled. A three yr old, on a cruise ship w/ his parents, finishes breakfast and announces he is going to see \"Sponge Bob\". His parents, thinking that he is going down to the cabin to watch TV agree that that is a good idea. The child proceeds to jump over the rail and drown in his attempt to visit Sponge Bob's who \"lives in a pineapple under the sea\".
 Origins: Parents  concerned with the pernicious influence of television on children could hardly find more innocuous children's TV fare these days than the Nickelodeon cartoon SpongeBob SquarePants, the animated adventures of a bright yellow sea sponge who dwells in a pineapple within the subterranean city of Bikini Bottom, works as a fry cook at the Krusty Krab, and pals around with his starfish friend, Patrick — usually to the general annoyance of Bob's cranky neighbor, Squidward. SpongeBob SquarePants is the top-rated show on broadcast or cable among youngsters 2 to 11 (even though an estimated 22% of its audience is 18 or older), the program is light-hearted and funny, the main character \"has an unending bounty of innocence and old-fashioned ethics,\" and the themes employed could satisfy even the most TV-cautious parents. (In one installment, Bob and Patrick order a big-screen TV because they want to play with the large box it's packaged in, but the irascible Squidward is too incredulous to believe they could be having so much fun disdaining the large television and using nothing more than an empty box and their imaginations.) So why did rumors of the drowning of a SpongeBob SquarePants-obsessed child begin to circulate in September of 2002, even though no such tragedy occurred? (The rumor didn't spring from a cancellation of the series; SpongeBob is slated to make his feature film debut in 2004, and Nickelodeon has stockpiled a cache of unaired episodes to dole out until then.) Parents have long been cautious, even fearful, of challenges to their authority and influence over their children, and most anything — particularly the new, unfamiliar, and faddish — that seems to occupy an inordinate amount of their children's time and attention is generally viewed with skepticism and suspicion. Television was a locus of these fears in the mid-1950s: From mid-decade on, the baleful effects of television on American life became a national obsession. Polls, surveys, and experts all agreed that something terrible was happening. People stayed in the house more and read good books less. Kids were glued to the set for three or four hours a day. The content of programming aroused \"morbid emotions in children,\" stirred up \"domestic quarrels, . . . loosed morals and ma[de] people lazy and sodden.\" The Kefauver Subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee issued a report late in 1955 suggesting that TV caused juvenile delinquency by inuring teenagers to lawless and violent behavior. The mechanism whereby clean-cut teens suddenly turned into blue-jeaned mobsters while watching TV was not specified in the report; perhaps moving pictures induced criminal restlessness in unformed characters . . . At issue was the change from an accepted style to something unfamiliar, from the Saturday matinee to weeknight TV, from crew cuts to ducktails and sideburns, from Dean Martin and Charles Van Doren to Elvis Presley.

 From Superman's leading kids to jump out of windows in attempts to fly to Beavis and Butthead's spurring a spate of adolescent fire-starting, television has spawned its own collection of rumors demonstrating its supposed ability to prompt dangerous behavior in youngsters — as well as reinforcing the notion that television itself is to blame. These rumors are not reflections of real events; they're cautionary tales expressive of adult fears and concerns. Several familiar \"parental nightmare\" elements can be identified in the Spongebob Squarepants rumor:    Of the four examples of the SpongeBob SquarePants drowning rumor cited above, only the last one even hints at the presence of responsible adults who should have prevented this apocryphal tragedy from occurring. Perhaps that point reflects the true horror of this rumor: parents who leave a three-year-old child to wander the decks of a cruise ship unattended and drown are the ones directly responsible for his death — not television, Nickelodeon, or cartoon characters.

While he was walking he felt an eye irritation, thinking that it was just regualr dust, he started to rub his eye, in an effort to remove the dust.... then his eyes got really red, and he went and bought some eye drops from a pharmacy....few days passed n his eyes were still red and seems a little swollen.
 
Again he dismissed it as the constant rubbing and that it will go away. The days go by the swelling of his eye got worse, redder and bigger.... till he decided to go and see a doctor for a check up.
 
The doctor immediately wanted an operation, being afraid of a tumor growth or cyst. At the operation, what was thought to be a growth or cyst, actually turned out to be a live worm..... what was thought initially to be just mere dust actually was an insect's egg......because of that, my friends, if u do get caught in dust, and the pain persists, pls go see a doctor immediately...... thank you....
 

 Origins: Tales of insects; living and growing and nesting inside the human body prompt some of the most visceral responses of all the types of horror legends. We can read about people being killed in all sorts of gruesome ways almost with equanimity, it seems, but the thought of creepy-crawlies inside our bodies sends shivers up and down our spines. (Just think how repulsed most people are by the sight of maggots, even when they're feeding on flesh that's already dead.) And if bugs are going to turn our own corporeal residences into homes for themselves, they could scarcely choose a more revulsion-inducing site than an eyeball — the location of the most important and vulnerable of our senses. Chilling as they are, the photos accompanying this item, at least, are real. They were taken from a July 2000 article appearing in the Archives of Ophthalmology (a journal published the American Medical Association) that describes and illustrates the removal of a human botfly larva from the eye of a 5-year-old by in Honduras by an Air Force mobile ophthalmic surgical team. As summarized by the article: A 5-year-old boy with inferior orbital swelling and an erythematous mass arising from the inferior cul-de-sac of his right eye was seen by an Air Force Mobile Ophthalmic Surgical Team working in a rural area of the Republic of Honduras. The respiratory pore of a late-stage larva of the human botfly (Dermatobia hominis) was located in the anterior orbit. The larva was gently removed under general anesthesia through a small incision in the conjunctiva Botflies (such as the one featured in these photos, the human botfly, or Dermatobia hominis, commonly found from central Mexico through to Central America and South America) are one of a number of insect species that lay their eggs on the exterior of other living creatures (usually mosquitoes or flies); when the eggs hatch, the larvae burrow into their \"hosts\" to feed (breathing through the small burrow holes) until they emerge to pupate into mature adult botflies. Generally, a female botfly's choosing a human host for her young poses no great threat to the human, and the infestation can be eliminated via a simple surgical procedure, as the cited article notes: Covering a larva's burrow hole with some type of ointment or fatty substance will generally remedy the problem; if not, a simple surgical procedure Also, as noted in the article, a botfly in the eye is far from a common occurrence, \"no previous case to our knowledge of orbital invasion hav[ing] been reported.\" Although the implication that some have taken from the Internet text accompanying this message — that getting \"bad dust\" in one's eye and rubbing the eye might somehow cause the type of problem shown here — is wrong, the gist of the message is correct: one should not dismiss a persistent swelling and itching of the eye as merely \"I've got something in the eye\"; it should be checked by a doctor as soon as possible.

"David Mikkelson" 2002-11-24 "Siblings are coincidentally killed in related automobile accidents." "Claim: Siblings are coincidentally killed in related automobile accidents. Status: True. Example: [Associated Press, 2002]  Authorities said the women were driving Jeeps in opposite directions on Alabama 25 Sunday when one of the vehicles crossed the center line, colliding with the other. Trooper Cpl. Stan Lemon said investigators were trying to determine which car was on the wrong side of the road and why. Sheila Wentworth, 45, and her sister, Doris Jean Hall, 51, were killed, along with Hall's husband, Billy Joe Hall Jr., 45. Two children — one riding in each vehicle — were injured: the Halls' granddaughter, 8-year-old Amber Jackson, and Wentworth's nephew, Frankie Whaley, 12. Amber was released from a hospital Monday. Frankie remained hospitalized in special care, said Sgt. Will Rogers.
 Origins: The phenomenon we loosely term \"coincidence\" comprises many classes of events: the happy (long-lost lovers rediscover each other by accident), the amusing (a potato grows in a shape resembling Richard Nixon's profile), the mundane (neighbors share the same birthday), the fortuitous (a hunch bet on a roulette wheel pays off), the eerie (a man is hit and killed by a car he'd sold ten years earlier), the life-saving (a last-minute change in travel plans heads off disaster) — and the tragic. The November 2002 incident described above, in which two Alabama sisters out to visit each other were both killed when their Jeeps collided head-on on a rural highway, is an example of the tragic form of coincidence. Sisters Sheila Wentworth and Doris Jean Hall died in the accident, as did Doris Jean's husband, Billy Joe Hall Jr. Although initial reports maintained both women were driving when their vehicles collided, a subsequent Associated Press correction clarified that Doris Jean was not behind the wheel at the time of the accident; she was a passenger in the Jeep being driven by her husband. Another form of tragic automobile accident-related coincidence involving siblings took place in October 2005, when 32-year-old Perry Harrell of Florence, South Carolina, died in a four-wheeler accident. Three days later, his widow and other family members were puzzled when Perry's brother, Larry Harrell, failed to show up at the funeral. A few hours later they learned that a traffic-clogging automobile accident they had passed on the highway while returning home from the services had claimed Larry's life as well — he had been killed in a car crash while driving to his brother's funeral. Although they weren't connected in any causal way, another set of accidents occurring in December 2005 claimed the life of siblings at about the same time and place. In the early morning hours of 7 December 2005, Andy McDowell, a sheriff's deputy in southern Kentucky's rural Warren County, spoke with his 23-year-old son Rory via a cell phone as the boy was driving his pickup truck. Shortly after that conversation Rory lost control of his vehicle coming around a curve, and the truck slammed into a tree, killing Rory. After Andy McDowell was taken to the site of his son's accident later that day, he was driven past the scene of another accident, and only later did he learn the nature of that second accident — about 15 minutes after Rory's crash, McDowell's other son, 21-year-old Cory, had also been killed when his 1984 Porsche veered off a road, spun out, hit a tree, and burst into flames. (Subsequent investigation revealed that the McDowell brothers had been in a bar with their father before the crashes, and both had blood alcohol levels far above the legal limit at the time of their accidents.) An eerily similar pair of accidents involving Steven Kerr, 37, and his brother, Jeremy Kerr, 29, took place in Pennsylvania on 5 August 2006. The two young men had been riding motorcycles together on a Saturday afternoon but eventually became separated; at about 8:55 P.M., Steven died when his motorcycle left the road and crashed into a speed limit sign. Jeremy heard about his brother's accident, went racing to the scene on his motorcycle, and was killed around 10:30 P.M. when he ran into the rear of a minivan — a vehicle that was stopped due to traffic congestion caused by Steven's earlier accident, a mere few hundred feet or so from the scene of the older brother's death.

"Barbara Mikkelson" 2002-04-30 "A man locked in an unplugged freezer imagined himself freezing to death and died as a result." "Claim: A man locked in an unplugged freezer imagined himself freezing to death and died as a result. LEGEND Examples:  A man finds himself locked in a walk in freezer. He is convinced he will die and begins writing letters. His letters end with a final passage where he is saying he can not write anymore because his fingers are beginning to freeze. When they find him dead, not only do they find the letters but they discover that the freezer's temperature never dropped below 50 degrees. Thus, the man pretty much psyched himself to death.
 
 [Van Ekeren, 1988] The expression \"worried to death\" has more truth to it than you might think. There is a story about Nick Sitzman, a strong, young bull-of-a-man, who worked on a train crew. It seemed Nick had everything: a strong healthy body, ambition, a wife and two children, and many friends. However, Nick had one fault. He was a notorious worrier. He worried about everything and usually feared the worst. One midsummer day, the train crew were informed that they could quit an hour early in honor of the foreman's birthday. Accidentally, Nick was locked in a refrigerator boxcar, and the rest of the workmen left the site. Nice panicked. He banged and shouted until his fists were bloody and his voice was hoarse. No one heard him. \"If I can't get out, I'll freeze to death in here,\" he thought. Wanting to let his wife and family know exactly what had happened to him, Nick found a knife and began to etch words on the wooden floor. He wrote, \"It's so cold, my body is getting numb. If I could just go to sleep. These may be my last words.\" The next morning the crew slid open the heavy doors of the boxcar and found Nick dead. An autopsy revealed that every physical sign of his body indicated he had frozen to death. And yet the refrigeration unit of the car was inoperative, and the temperature inside indicated fifty-five degrees. Nick had killed himself by the power of worry.
 Origins: Can someone really think himself to death? That is the point of this legend: the mind is a powerful thing; so powerful that it can kill. This story has often been passed along by motivational speakers as an example of the power of one's mind. We've been hearing versions of this story for years, tales in which the details change but the theme remains that of an unfortunate man who dies after he is trapped in a situation which he presumes to be dangerous but is later revealed not to have posed any real threat to his well-being: The air-tight room he's locked in turns out to have a vent to the outside which brings a steady supply of fresh air but the man suffocates because he believes he's used up all the oxygen; the cooling unit on the refrigerated boxcar he's trapped in isn't turned on, but the man stuck inside the car slowly succumbs to hypothermia nonetheless. Because this type of story involves a death caused by something contradictory to the physical evidence, a search of the deceased's pockets or a quick glance at the floor or walls will inevitably turn up a note detailing the final hours of his life. The note is a necessary plot element in this sort of tale, as the victim's thoughts just prior to his death are key to the story, and those are details we couldn't know without his conveniently having left a written record of what he'd been thinking. The theme of a physically unharmed victim who passes away only because he believes himself to be dying underpins another urban legend. In \"Lethal Indirection,\" a fellow who believes himself to have been executed dies of a heart attack. Could someone really think himself to death? The jury may still be out on that concept, but we've yet to find any documentation for the claim that someone once died because his power of thought turned him into a corpsicle.

"Barbara Mikkelson" 2002-03-15 "The ghost of a woman killed in a car crash directs rescuers to the wreck to save her still-living baby, who is trapped within." "Whether one ascribes \"ghostly intervention\" stories to God or to earthly ties so strong they empower the deceased to reach back from the grave, this legend type is hugely popular because it confirms one's personal belief system (i.e., that God is all powerful and will engineer a miracle to save an innocent, or that the love of a parent will overpower death itself if the child is in danger). One afternoon, a couple was traveling on the road when all of a sudden at a far distance they saw a woman in the middle of the road asking them to stop. The wife told her husband to keep on driving because it might be too dangerous, but the husband decided to pass by slowly so he wouldn't stay with the doubt on his mind of what might have happened and the chances of anyone being hurt. As they got closer, they noticed a woman with cuts and bruises on her face as well as on her arms. They then decide to stop and see if they could be of any help. The cut and bruised woman was begging for help telling them that she had been in a car accident and that her husband and son, a new born baby, were still inside the car which was in a deep ditch. She told them that the husband was already dead but that her baby seemed to still be alive. The husband that was traveling decided to get down and try to rescue the baby and he asked the hurt woman to stay with his wife inside the their car. When he got down he noticed two people in the front seats of the car but he didn't pay any importance to it and took out the baby quickly and got up to take the baby to it's mother. When he got up, he didn't see the mother anywhere so he asked his wife where she had gone. She told him that the woman followed him back to the crashed car. When the man decided to go look for the woman, he noticed that clearly the two people in the front seats were dead; a woman and a man with both their seatbelts on. When he looked closer, he noticed that it was the exact same woman that was begging them for help in the beginning. Do you think that it was a miracle of God? The Baby now lives with family members and he will live to tell the story. If you believe in the Almighty and that miracles like these can truly happen, send this to your friends. If you don't send it, nothing will happen, only that the some people won't be able to know of the greatness of the Lord. Comfort is also found in legends of this ilk due to the implied promise that parental protection will outlast the lives of the caregivers themselves, and that Mother and Father will still always be there in times of need. For folks desperately trying to come to terms with the loss (or projected loss) of a parent, this reassurance is most welcome. A drunk man in an Oldsmobile,
they said, had run the light
that caused the six-car pileup
on 109 that night. When broken bodies lay about
and blood was everywhere,
the sirens screamed out elegies
for death was in the air. A mother, trapped inside her car,
was heard above the noise;
her plaintive plea near split the air:
\"Oh, God, please spare my boys!\" She fought to loose her pinioned hands;
she struggled to get free,
but mangled metal held her fast
in grim captivity. Her frightened eyes then focused
on where the back seat once had been,
but all she saw was broken glass and
two children's seats crushed in. Her twins were nowhere to be seen;
she did not hear them cry,
and then she prayed they'd been thrown free,
\"Oh, God, don't let them die!\" Then firemen came and cut her loose,
but when they searched the back,
they found therein no little boys,
but the seat belts were intact. They thought the woman had gone mad
and was traveling alone,
but when they turned to question her,
they discovered she was gone. Policemen saw her running wild
and screaming above the noise
in beseeching supplication,
Please help me find my boys! They're four years old and wear blue shirts;
their jeans are blue to match.\"
One cop spoke up, \"They're in my car,
and they don't have a scratch. They said their daddy put them there
and gave them each a cone,
then told them both to wait for Mom
to come and take them home. I've searched the area high and low,
but I can't find their dad.
He must have fled the scene,
I guess, and that is very bad.\" The mother hugged the twins and said,
while wiping at a tear,
\"He could not flee the scene,
you see, for he's been dead a year.\" The cop just looked confused and asked,
\"Now, how can that be true?\"
The boys said, \"Mommy, Daddy came
and left a kiss for you. He told us not to worry
and that you would be all right,
and then he put us in this car with
the pretty, flashing light. We wanted him to stay with us,
because we miss him so,
but Mommy, he just hugged us tight
and said he had to go. He said someday we'd understand
and told us not to fuss,
and he said to tell you, Mommy,
he's watching over us.\" The mother knew without a doubt
that what they spoke was true,
for she recalled their dad's last words,
\"I will watch over you.\" The firemen's notes could not explain
the twisted, mangled car,
and how the three of them escaped
without a single scar. But on the cop's report was scribed,
in print so very fine,
An angel walked the beat tonight
on Highway 109. By Ruth Gillis

Ruth's House of Poetry In the world of folklore, ghosts have been fetching help for the still living almost since time began. Observe this example harvested by Brunvand from an 1981 newspaper: There is a story going about town that is worthy of attention. The only question is whether it is true, and to what extent. The other day, somewhere on Sergievskaya Street, or near it, a priest carrying the holy sacraments came to a certain apartment after mass. A young man answered the door. \"I was asked to come here and give the sacraments to a sick man,\" said the priest. \"You must have made a mistake. Nobody lives here except me.\" \"No, a lady came up to me today and gave me this very address and asked me to give the sacraments to the man who lives here.\" The young apartment dweller was perplexed. \"Why look, that is the very woman who asked me to come,\" said the priest, pointing to a woman's portrait hanging on the wall. \"That is the portrait of my dead mother.\" Awe, fear, terror seized hold of the young man. Under the impression of all this he took communion. That evening he lay dead. Such is the story. Versions of the story quoted immediately above were part of oral lore at least as far back as 1890 in at least three countries (Russia, England and Canada). The \"summoned help\" is either a doctor or a member of the clergy. Such tales of loved ones fetching help and only afterwards being identified as deceased via their being identified through their portraits continue to circulate: There came a frantic knock
At the doctor's office door,
A knock, more urgent than
he had ever heard before. \"Come in, Come in,\"
the impatient doctor said,
\"Come in, Come in,
before you wake the dead.\" In walked a frightened little girl,
a child no more than nine,
It was plain for all to see,
she had troubles on her mind. \"Oh doctor, I beg you,
please come with me,
My mother is surely dying,
she's as sick as she can be.\" \"I don't make house calls,
bring your mother here,\"
\"But she's too sick,
so you must come or she will die I fear.\" The doctor, touched by her devotion,
decided he would go,
She said he would be blessed,
more than he could know. She led him to her house
where her mother lay in bed,
Her mother was so very sick
she couldn't raise her head. But her eyes cried out for help
and help her the doctor did,
She would have died that very night
had it not been for her kid. The doctor got her fever down
and she lived through the night,
And morning brought the doctor signs,
that she would be all right. The doctor said he had to leave
but would return again by two,
And later he came back to check,
just like he said he'd do. The mother praised the doctor
for all the things he'd done,
He told her she would have died,
were it not for her little one. \"How proud you must be
of your wonderful little girl,
It was her pleading that made me come,
she is really quite a pearl! \"But doctor, my daughter died
over three years ago,
Is the picture on the wall
of the little girl you know?\" The doctors legs went limp
for the picture on the wall,
Was the same little girl
for whom he'd made this call. The doctor stood motionless,
for quite a little while,
And then his solemn face,
was broken by his smile. He was thinking of that frantic knock
heard at his office door,
And of the beautiful little angel
that had walked across his floor. These days, we tend to envision crises worthy of summoning ghostly parents back to do their duty as involving life-threatening physical danger to the child, so in modern tellings of this legend, the parent returns to direct rescuers to a trapped youngster who might otherwise be overlooked or to scoop up the injured tot herself and bring it to a doctor or nearby hospital. But in older versions, the crisis that would kickstart a deceased parent to intervene was spiritual, not physical. In the example quoted above, the ghost mom fetches help not to save the life of her child, but its soul. Popular culture is replete with examples of this legend type, some involving parents and their endangered offspring, some involving spouses (the 1990 film Ghost fleshed out this folktale to make a full-length movie of it), and some involving friends (such as in the 1978 Stephen King novel and 1994 mini-series The Stand when Nick appears to Tom in a dream to direct him to the right medicine to save Stu, who is dying)." 2002 "Mar" 3 1890

Example: [Collected on the Internet, 2002]  Mans Death Cause For Concern When the fog lifted outside of Sanger on Friday morning, November 1, 2001,
18 year old Stuart Bidasoe was found slumped over dead in the drivers seat of his Silver 1997 Saturn. Beside him was a bag of Halloween candy. It appears that in the dense fog, Thursday night, he had run off the road and hit a fence post causing the airbag to deploy. Officer Benson of The California Highway Patrol could find no apparent reason for Bidasoe's death. A drug overdose was suspected but no drugs were found on Bidasoe's person or in the car. It was not until he was transported to the county morgue that the mystery was solved. Stu Bidasoe had attended a Halloween Party and was on his way home. He had a lollypop in his mouth and in the dense fog ran off the road, hit the fence post inflating the airbag, pushing the lollypop into his throat. He suffocated before help could arrive. Bidasoe's distraught parents are seeking legal advice.
 Origins: The year 2002 kicked off with yet another specious \"freakish fatality\" tale. Short and sweet, no such death was mentioned in any U.S. paper, in California or elsewhere. The Social Security Death Index also contains no mention of anyone named Bidasoe. (The name of the victim provides a further clue to the intent of the author of the tale: \"Stu Bidasoe.\" Or, for those who sound things out, \"Stupid Asshole.\") The meme of \"mysterious death caused by implement which has since been ingested or melted away\" is a hoary one. Children routinely query one another with the following puzzle: A pool of red A man is dead A stick nearby How did he die? In the riddle's case, the instrument of the man's demise is a cherry popsicle that he chokes on (or that was laced with poison). The \"pool of red\" refers to the melted remains of the popsicle; the \"stick nearby\" is the stick the iced confection had been frozen upon. Those fond of mystery short stories will no doubt recall a number of similarly-themed tales wherein murderers do in their victims with implements that subsquently melt or are eaten. The \"stabbed to death with an icicle\" plot is a classic, as is the \"walloped over the head with a roast.\" The latter's most famous use was in the Roald Dahl short story, \"Lamb to the Slaughter\" (which was subsequently dramatized on Alfred Hitchcock Presents on 13 April 1958). In that tale, a wife bludgeons her husband to death with a frozen leg of lamb. The police sent to investigate the death speculate upon the lack of murder weapon at the scene, even as they dine on the now roasted leg of lamb the murderess has invited them to partake of.

"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/poison-perfume-samples/" "false" "A warning from \"Glen Eagles\" hospital about the deaths of women who sniffed poisoned perfume samples is an old hoax." "Barbara Mikkelson" 2001-11-03 "Glen Eagles hospital issued an urgent warning because seven women have died after sniffing perfume samples received in the mail." "A warning about women killed by poisoned perfume samples surfaced in e-mail in mid-October 2001, a month after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, and versions of it have periodically circulated since then in various online forms: Very Important ! URGENT News from Glen Eagles Hospital URGENT !!!!! Seven women have died after inhaling a free perfume sample that was mailed to them. The product was poisonous . If you receive free samples in the mail such as lotions, perfumes, diapers etc. throw them away . The government is afraid that this might be another terrorist act . They will not announce it in the news because they do not want to create panic or give the terrorists new ideas. Send this Fwd: to all your friends and family members. Diane J. Ford

Washington, DC Anthrax poison in Tide detergent packs coming through the mail. Do not open or use, 7 dead already. This is real not a chain letter. Alert !!!!!DO NOT OPEN ANY FREE Colonges, lotions, soaps or any products, such as this, that might be in your mailbox or offered to you free, anywhere in public places. If you smell these you could die. I had a text alert come to me through my Verizon Phone from a Goverment Agent, just as probally a lot of you have. It is serious!! They think this is another terrorist attack. It Is legit TO ALL FACEBOOK FRIENDS : CNN has issued a warning!!!! If you get anything in the mail pertaining to Tide (Detergent) DON'T OPEN IT! Toss It immediately (ANTHRAX) 7 people have died !!1 Please do not take this lightly !!! There was nothing to the claim, and no such deaths occurred. Its premise that the government was keeping such news from the public so as not to cause panic was rather far-fetched, given that at the time Attorney General John Ashcroft was repeating vague warnings about further terrorist activity to come and the media's fascination with reporting the anthrax spore mailings that eventually killed five people. Even if the government had the power to keep such news under wraps, is it at all reasonable to believe seven grieving families would have stayed completely silent about the deaths of their loved ones? By 2010, the alert had morphed into one warning against all manner of samples offered to consumers, either placed in their mailboxes or handed to them directly. At that time as well, Tide detergent samples were particularly singled out, usually with the assertion that they contained anthrax. By January 2012, the warning about Tide detergent samples was being spread by cell phone text message. These subsequent rumors were also false. This baseless bit of scarelore appeared to be a combination of two older, equally unfounded pieces of the same genre: the perfume robbers tale (women in parking lots lured into sniffing cut-rate perfume lose consciousness and are robbed while they're out) and the Klingerman virus scare (blue virus-laden sponges mailed in envelopes marked \"A gift for you from the Klingerman Foundation\" have caused 23 deaths). But lore moves forward with the times, so this newer caution incorporated \"terrorists\" (presumably Middle Eastern) into the mix. One of the ways we cope with terrifying times is to try to fill in the gaps of the unknown. In frantic pursuit of this goal, misinformation and information are accorded almost the same weight, and rumors and \"warnings\" speed along on very fast feet indeed. Such heads up as this fallacious e-mail express not only fears about deadly substances arriving by mail, but they also help us feel better about having to live in such dangerous times through the reduction of a nebulous lurking threat to a matter of something that can be dealt with. \"Beware of perfume samples\" is far less indistinct (and thus far less unsettling) than \"Beware of all mail,\" let alone the anxiety-ridden reality of \"We don't know where, when, or how the next attack will occur, so be wary of everything.\" In early 2002, this particular warning received a shot in the arm from having been passed through the County Attorney's office of Harris County, Texas. Franchell Plummer, an administrative assistant working for that service received the e-mailed warning from a friend and unthinkingly forwarded it to others in the manner that so many do. Her signature block became incorporated into the alert, with many taking its presence there as a sign that the information contained in the warning had been vetted by a state attorney's office and that indeed this was an official warning about a real and verified threat. It wasn't real; it was a case of a low-level employee's forwarding baseless scaremail to others. Ms. Plummer was officially reprimanded for her act, and the Harris County Attorney's office disavowed the e-mail and told everyone who called to ask that it was a hoax. A version that completed with the tagline \"JHU Office of Communications & Public Affairs\" has been similarly disclaimed by that institution. According to Dennis O'Shea, executive director of communications and public affairs at The Johns Hopkins University, \"This warning message was not issued by my office nor has my office in any way authorized it or any message like it.\" In June 2010 a version of this hoax prefaced with an \"URGENT News from Gleneagles Hospital\" headline surfaced and was disseminated not only via e-mail but also through cell phone text messages and Facebook posts. The rumor spread widely enough that Gleneagles Hospital and Medical Centre (which is based in Singapore) posted a disclaimer on their web site: Recently, an email and short message service (SMS) has been circulating amongst members of the public pertaining to a poisonous perfume sample which caused the death of seven women upon inhalation and exposure. It was purportedly sent by a person who claimed to be an employee of Gleneagles Hospital Limited, on behalf of the hospital, in order to warn the public as these seven women were supposedly admitted and treated at Gleneagles Hospital. We understand the panic and mystification that this email has caused and the public's need to seek verification and consolation from a reliable medical institution such as ours. Thus, we would like to highlight that we have never admitted or treated such patients and have never been aware of such incidences. We would also like to categorically state that this email did not originate from our Hospital and / or any of our employees, current or otherwise. In addition, we declare that no one was ever at any time commissioned or authorised by the Hospital to deliver and circulate such warnings. Further to this, we would also like to point out that our registered company name is Gleneagles Hospital (Kuala Lumpur) Sdn. Bhd. (Co. No. 198498-T) and we were never at any point known as Gleneagles Hospital Limited as claimed in the email. This email hoax first surfaced five years ago, and we had posted a statement on the GIMC website to clarify and inform members of the public that the contents of the email were a hoax. In view of the above, we sincerely hope that all members of the public who had read this email and our clarification will inform everyone around them that this is a hoax and urge everyone to ignore and delete such emails in the future. Thank you. A variant of this scare which began circulating in mid-2010 cautioned about mailed samples of Tide brand detergent supposedly containing anthrax. In January 2011, that scare was spread by text messages sent to cell phones, some of them asserting \"It was on CNN today!\" Those warnings were equally spurious — no such incidents have been reported (on CNN or elsewhere), and Tide company representatives stated that: I can 100% confirm that the text message going around is not true. From time to time people do this kind of thing as a prank, unfortunately there is little we can do other than to share the fact that this is completely unfounded. If you are concerned or want further reassurance please contact our Consumer Relations team on: 1-800-879-8433 On or around 12 April 2016, the warning (reproduced as images above) began circulating on Facebook. Once again, it held that \"Glen Eagles\" hospital had warned that seven women had died after inhaling perfume samples sent to them via mail. The warning was widely shared across the United States, despite most sharers not knowing what or where \"Glen Eagles\" hospital might be. Many versions of the claim added speculation that ISIS might be behind the attacks, or that the news media had kept a lid on the seven deaths so as not to inspire terrorism or cause panic. No dates, cause of death, mechanism of poisoning, or other details were provided about the purported tainted perfume samples and their relationship with \"Glen Eagles,\" nor did those warnings anyone explain why seven women and one hospital had been targeted in the scheme. In 2013, Malaysia's My Star published an article about the recurring e-mail hoax and its move to social media: Gleneagles Hospital Kuala Lumpur has refuted a message that has been circulating via email and SMS claiming that a poisonous perfume sample caused the death of seven women upon inhalation and exposure in the Hospital. Gleneagles Hospital Kuala Lumpur Public Relations and Communications manager Adeline Abdul Ghani said on Friday that the email was a hoax and did not originate from the Hospital from any of its employees, current or otherwise. “We understand the panic and mystification that this email has caused and the public’s need to seek verification and consolation from a reliable medical institution such as ours ... we would like to highlight that we have never admitted or treated such patients and have never been aware of such incidences,” she said in a statement. “We would also like to categorically state in addition, we declare that no one was ever at any time commissioned or authorised by the Hospital to deliver and circulate such warnings,” she added. “This email hoax first surfaced eleven years ago, and we will post a statement on the GKL website and Facebook to clarify and inform members of the public that the contents of the email were a hoax,” Adeline said. “We sincerely hope that all members of the public who had read this email and our clarification will inform everyone around them that this is a hoax and urge everyone to ignore and delete such emails in the future,” she added." 2001 "Nov" 11 2000

"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/cat-o-nine-tales/" "legend" "Rumor has it that black cats are subjected to all sorts of unkind and even cruel activity around Halloween." "David Mikkelson" 2001-10-30 "Black cats are routinely sacrificed by \"satanic cults\" at Halloween." "Halloween is a festival many of our pets could do without. Our dogs and cats don't appreciate the symbolism and revelry of All Hallow's Eve; to most of them the evening is a frightening collage of trick-or-treaters and party-goers who noisily shuffle from house to house, pound on doors, and engage in a variety of mischief. Even worse, pets who remain outside on Halloween are subject to becoming the targets of pranks ranging from the comic to the cruel. Example: Black cats, beware. Long associated with witches, bad luck and the dark side, black felines are often used for pranks, party props and even satanic, sacrificial rituals around Halloween. \"This is a time when blood rituals take place,\" said Hedy Litke, director of animal placement at the ASPCA. \"Black cats are often sacrificed.\" Such is their popularity that many shelters in New York and around the country ban adoptions of black cats in the weeks and days preceding Oct. 31 to protect them from potentially grisly endings. Unfortunately, Halloween has also been a time when some people acquire pets — particularly cats — to use as living decorations or for displays of fun and sport, only to discard or abandon them afterwards (as often happens with chicks and rabbits at Easter time). Accordingly, many animal shelters have taken steps in recent years to limit or eliminate the adoption of cats in the days leading up to Halloween by either deferring feline adoptions until after Halloween or by more carefully scrutinizing the prospective adopters. One of the more widely-cited justifications for the implementation of more stringent adoption policies by animal shelters around Halloween is the claim that cats in general — and black cats in particular — are avidly sought by members of \"satanic cults\" who engage in the mutilation, torture, and killing of cats in celebrations associated or coincident with Halloween. That animal shelter policy has been influenced by a widespread belief in satanic cat-sacrificing rituals at Halloween is beyond dispute; the issue here is whether such activity is really as prevalent as the belief in it is. First of all, depending upon which source you believe, the alleged practice of sacrificing black cats began with \"Druid priests,\" \"pagans,\" or the (Christian) \"Church\": More than 2,000 years ago, in the area we know now as Ireland, England, Scotland and Wales, Druid priests capitalized upon such fears by nurturing the belief that evil spirits were responsible for bringing about the advent of cold weather and shorter hours of daylight. To placate the spirits, the priests initiated a festival honoring Samhain, the lord of the dead. The festival was on Oct. 31, the day before the beginning of the Celtic new year. This \"new year's eve\" celebration gradually grew to ominous proportions. The priests ordered the people to extinguish all hearth fires and to gather around huge bonfires on hilltops. The fires were intended to frighten away the evil spirits and to honor the souls of people who had died during the past year. Religious rituals performed around the bonfires were followed by processions back into the villages, where embers from the large fires were used to reignite the hearth fires in each home. The notion then developed that the souls of sinful persons, as well as all other evil spirits, were at large in the community during that night. To discourage these mysterious entities from acts of retribution, sacrifices were thrown into the bonfires. At first, the sacrifices were domesticated animals. Horses were popular because they were believed to be sacred to the Sun God, who needed attention because he was punishing the people by giving them fewer hours of daylight. Black cats were a favorite sacrifice because they were thought to be evil spirits transformed into animals.1
 
 Sacrificing cats began in medieval times, when the Church decreed that felines were friends of the devil. With their darting eyes and sinister-looking coats the color of death, black cats became known as witches' mascots. They also were known as \"familiars,\" through which witches could communicate with the spiritual world.2 (Note that we do not offer the above quotations as valid historical accounts, but merely as examples of popular contemporary explanations as to why people supposedly sacrifice black cats at Halloween.) When questioned about their October policies, most animal shelter and humane society representatives affirm their belief that steps are necessary to prevent cats from becoming sacrificial Halloween victims but offer no tangible evidence that the phenomenon is real beyond their belief in it: \"As horrible as this may sound, cats are tortured around Halloween time,\" said Deborah Thomas, executive director of the Maryland SPCA, which for years has enforced a virtual moratorium on black cat adoptions in the days before Halloween. \"It's just incredible what people will do to cats, as if they don't have any feelings.\" Although concrete information on Halloween cat cruelty is hard to obtain, shelters in Maryland and across the country for years have taken special care of black cats this time of year.3
 
 \"Some satanic cults sacrifice all-black or all-white cats as part of their rituals,\" said Nancy Suro, director of the Maxfund, a pet-adoption agency.
 
For the past six years, the Maxfund has called an annual October moratorium on any adoptions involving all-black or all-white cats. Even though Suro acknowledged she doesn't know how widespread the problem is, she said: \"I know such activity goes on. We absolutely refuse to take any chances with these cats' lives.\"4 The problem — or the perception of it — follows folkloric patterns, with anecdotal reports becoming ever wider in scope. For example, ritualistic Halloween sacrifices are said to make use of white cats as well as black cats: Although black cats are at greater risk when it comes to cult sacrifices, white cats — because of their link to purity and virginity — have become a target in recent years.4 The problem is also said to have expanded to endanger cats of any color: Black cats are taboo. At least that's the rule at area shelters where black felines are locked away until after the holiday. Too often cats were adopted as accessories to costumes and spooky parties, then abandoned. \"There are also so-called religious groups that sacrifice animals,\" said Leslie Eppick of the Glendale SPCA. \"If desperate, they will take any cat, no matter what color.\"5 The activity is said to be no longer restricted to Halloween and to occur on other \"satanic holidays\" as well: Nicky Ratliff, executive director of Humane Society of Carroll County [Maryland], does not allow black cats to be adopted before Halloween. \"Not only black cats, but also solid white cats. And not only on Halloween, but on several holidays on the satanic calendar,\" Ratliff said.3 The catnappings are said to be starting ever earlier in the year: When Tina Sowers' lovable black cat, Isaiah, disappeared Oct. 5, she struggled to stay positive. \"But by the next evening it all started to sink in,\" said Sowers, who shares her home with five other felines, all of varying colors. Isaiah's black, it's nearly Halloween, and he's the only cat that's missing from her home. \"It's an awful thing to think about but there are people who do these things to cats around this time of year,\" the north Phoenix housewife said. \"Me and my neighbors know we have to protect our cats, but it's so early in October.\"6 Halloween-related animal abductions are said to not only begin as early as August, but to include several breeds of dogs as well: Lillian Dubois-Tercero, president and executive director of Arizona Pet Line, a non-profit lost-and-found pet service in Phoenix, said that according to her computerized records, Halloween catnapping commences as early as late August. \"Already this year we have reports of 21 missing black cats, 12 white cats and 15 dogs from the end of August to October 14,\" she said, all within an area that runs from 51st Avenue to 32nd Street and Thomas to Cactus roads. It's also a tally that is right on target with numbers from the past three years. \"The disappearance of symbolized occult animals like black and white cats and Rottweilers, Dobermans and Great Danes starts the same time every year,\" she said.6 What to make of all these claims? Contemporary news accounts are a bundle of contradictory and conflicting information. Some veterinarians, law enforcement officials, and shelter operators assert that claims of feline sacrifices at Halloween are overblown: Dr. Leslie Sinclair, a veterinarian who is director of companion animal care for the Humane Society of the United States, said shelters across the country ban adoptions at this time of year — or at least closely scrutinize adoption applicants. Although many shelter operators acknowledge having little or no first-hand experience with animal sacrifices on Halloween, they have long traded tales of black cats being decapitated, disemboweled or skinned to mark the holiday. Shelter operators say pet owners should keep their pets indoors at Halloween. But tales of widespread animal torture on Halloween might be more legend than real, Sinclair said. She said that society officials employed a clipping service to survey news accounts of feline carnage surrounding Halloween 1996 — and found nothing. Michael F. Ryan — an investigator with the Baltimore state's attorney's office who has advised police departments on the practices of devil worshipers — said no one should fear that black cats are about to be singled out for satanic sacrifice. \"It's no more significant than a white dog, a brown dog or a polka-dotted kangaroo,\" he said. \"The more attention people give to this myth, it just helps to ride along on a wave that takes on a life of its own. It's just not there.3 Some offer accounts that border on the ridiculous to validate their belief in satanic catnappings: Two years ago, shelter workers at the Brooklyn Animal Resource Coalition in Williamsburg were on red alert when a woman dressed as a witch came in and insisted on adopting a black cat. \"We told her no,\" said BARC Vice President Vinny Spinola, whose shelter receives more than a dozen requests for black cats each Halloween and also has issued a moratorium on black-cat adoptions. \"We knew she only wanted the cat for a Halloween ritual.\" Litke at ASPCA recalled a spooky episode with a woman who had adopted a black cat. \"We called two days later to check on the cat, and she told us the cat was dead.\" The woman wouldn't tell the ASPCA how the cat died but said workers could pick up the body. \"When we got there, she was gone . . . and so was the cat,\" Litke said. \"All we found was an empty apartment. We never found the body.\"2 Some offer scattered anecdotal accounts of black cat mutilations: Interviews with shelter managers and a search of regional newspapers turned up nearly a dozen reports of black cat mutilations over the past four Halloweens. Cat bones and body parts were found near a Teterboro, N.J., shelter. In Wausau, Wis., a black cat was shaved and an occult insignia was carved into its side. A black cat was burned alive in Doylestown, Ohio. In Sanford, Fla., authorities found one black cat beheaded and three others with knife wounds.7 Although no law enforcement agency or animal protection group we contacted could provide statistics about Halloween-related animal killings or abuse, the consensus is that although incidents of animal abuse may rise slightly around Halloween, it's a year-around problem, and it has far more to do with poorly-behaved kids than with organized \"satanic cults\": Far too often, the animals are tortured and sacrificed during pseudo satanic-based rituals. \"But not by the real religious satanic groups,\" [Lillian Dubois-Tercero, president and executive director of Arizona Pet Line] stressed. \"They don't sacrifice cats and dogs. It's the idiot juveniles (who are) responsible who don't know what they're doing.\" Kim Hicks, spokesperson for the Arizona Humane Society, agreed that it's not religious groups such as the Wiccans that are stealing and killing animals. \"Wiccans are actually an anti-cruelty (to animals) group who hold animals in a higher regard than they do humans,\" she said. \"I think it's more like the people who dabble in the occult who are dangerous, and my guess would be it's troubled teenagers.\" The problem is magnified at Halloween time, when any unusual or unexplained animal death is automatically attributed to Halloween-related satanic activity: Hicks cited a series of 12 to 14 cat torture and mutilation cases last fall in the Ahwatukee Foothills, five of which were confirmed by necropsies to have been killed by humans. All were thought to be perpetrated by neighborhood teens.6 Note that the article cited above refers to \"12 to 14 cat torture and mutilation cases\" but avers that only five of the cats were confirmed to have been killed by \"humans.\" If the other seven to nine cases had not been linked to human activity, then why were they reported as incidents of \"torture and mutilation\"? The fact is that cats are frequently killed by larger animals such as coyotes and through a variety of accidental means, but both types of deaths (and unexplained disappearances) are often mistakenly chalked up to the work of \"satanic cults\" and described as cases of \"torture and mutilation\" when the deaths occur around Halloween. Some argue that, real phenomenon or not, Halloween cat sacrifices don't merit a radical change in shelters' adoption policies, because that's not where the perpetrators obtain their animals: ''We definitely get a little tighter in our adoption screening, especially the week before Halloween, and we don't allow any black-cat adoptions on Halloween day,'' said Karen Gnaegy, manager of the Animal Rescue and Adoption Society. But she added: ''Most cults are going to get their cats off their streets. They're not going to come into a shelter and pay $40 and go through a background check.''4 Are the dangers \"satanic rites\" pose to cats at Halloween time a real, widespread phenomenon, or largely a self-perpetuating Halloween myth? What evidence we could gather was inconclusive. Certainly, though, shelters' being extra-careful with feline adoptions just before Halloween to prevent the \"renting\" of cats for decorative purposes is a prudent precaution. If Halloween policies also help dissuade those who might inflict harm on adopted pets, so much the better." 2001 "Oct" 10 1990

"David Mikkelson" 2001-10-12 "An attempted abduction of a child from a mall or amusement park was thwarted because the kidnappers forgot to change the child's shoes." "One of the most effective types of scarelore is the \"barely escaped from the clutches of evil\" variety, as nothing drives home a warning better than a vivid first-person account of a narrowly-averted tragedy. The explicit warning presented in a common child abduction legend is obvious: You must never, ever let your child out of your sight in a public place, even for a moment — kidnappers could be lurking anywhere, and the attempted abduction in the following examples was foiled only due to the diligence of an employee and the thoroughness of a store's security precautions: CHILD ALERT Please take the time and forward this to any friend who has children! Thanks! Wanted to share something that happened today while shopping at Sam's club. A mother was leaning over looking for meat and turned around to find her 4 yr. old daughter was missing, I was standing there right beside her, well she was calling her daughter and no luck. I asked a man who worked at Sam's to announce it over the loud speaker for Katie. Well, he did, and let me say he walked past me when I asked and went to a pole where there was a phone right there to make his announcement for all doors, and gates to be locked a code something...so they locked all the doors at once. This took all of 3 min after I asked the guy to do this. They found the little girl 5 min later crunched in a bathroom stall, her head was half shaved, and she was dressed in her underwear with a bag of clothes, a razor, and wig sitting on the floor besides her. Whoever this person was, took the little girl, brought her into the bathroom, shaved half her head, undressed her in a matter of less than 10 min. Makes me shake to no end. Please keep an eye out for your kids when in shopping places. It only took a few minutes to do all of this, another 5 min and she would have been out the door...I am still in shock some sick person could do this, let alone in a matter of minutes...The little girl is fine... thank God for fast workers who didn't take any chances. Thanks for reading. Please keep praying for our children. Especially now that school is about to start. Just reading this was enough for me. I'm making a pledge to keep watch for all kids, young and old! We know those little kids slip by us so fast when we are in a store. Especially when they see toys or candy. Everything can be replaced but a life. No parent would want to lose a child in no way form or fashion!  [Collected via e-mail, March 2008] One of my brother's works at the Sam's Club in Murfreesboro, TN and yesterday he called me with some very disturbing news. As most stores, Sam's has different codes that are stated over the intercom throughout the store such as for extra help, severe weather, etc. Sam’s has a code called \"Code Adam\" for when a child becomes missing or is feared kidnapped. The store is immediately shut down and employees are instructed to go to an entrance/exit. That code was called yesterday at his store. A mother had her four year old daughter standing next to her as she was looking in the meat department. Then she noticed she was gone and notified a manager who then notified the store manager. Immediately, the \"Code Adam\" was called and all employees went to each exit in the store not allowing anyone to enter or exit. They found the little girl in the bathroom with the predator. Her head was partially shaved, she had on a different outfit, and a wig was found. This all happened within less than five minutes. Thank God Sam's Club has this sort of \"code\" or that little girl would have been gone. I wanted to pass this along to each of you so that you are aware that predators seem to be less fearful and braver these days. Please pass this along to anyone you know with small children.  [Collected via e-mail, November 2009] Dear All. This is a very serious message that I hope you can pass on to as many people as you can. Last night at the big ASDA in Bradley a three-year-old girl went missing. Fortunately their policy when something like this happens is to lock the doors. The little girl was found in the toilets with two Romanian women, one shaving her head and the other dressing her in boys' clothes. This comes from an employee who was there last night. Please pass the message round to as many as you can and remain extra vigilant with your own children.  [Collected via e-mail, August 2011] Friend of Ana's went to Wonderland yesterday. She was with another friend too and together they had 4 children (each w 2). Kids were 4-5-6 years old. While they were busy w 1 of the 4 kids one of the other kids disappeared ... Literally. 5 year old girl. After frantically searching for 2 minutes they alerted the Park's security who then searched the Park for the next 5-6 mins. The Park then closed all exits and would not allow anyone too leave while they continued to search for the next 45 mins. Still they couldn't find her and the Park was forced to re-open the exits. The Police advised Ana's friend to focus on childrens' shoes and nothing else. So she watched the exits and mobs of people were leaving. She noticed 1 man carrying a sleeping child with a blanket over her. And the child's hair was a different colour but she said to the police that she had noticed a child wearing the same shoes but ....... it probably wasn't her child. The police stopped the man and it turns out that it was indeed the right child. The child had been tranquillized by injection to the neck and was sleeping. Her hair had been cut short and had been spray painted a different colour. And all her clothing had been changed except .... her shoes. They got the perp and, thank God the child is fine. Moral: don't take your eyes off your child for even 1 second. Unbelievable!!! Although these warnings may contain some good advice, the legend they present exaggerates both the prevalence and manner of kidnappings. A child is far more likely to be snatched by a family member or ex-spouse in a custodial dispute than to be the victim of a random abduction. And rarely will kidnappers go through such elaborate procedures as the ones hinted at here -- luring a child outside where he or she can be quickly bundled into an automobile is far more effective and less risky than trying to smuggle one out the exit of a crowded public space. (Some of the examples presented above don't even make much logical sense. Why would abductors waste precious getaway time shaving a child's head — with a razor, yet — when they already had a wig on hand to disguise their victim's natural hair color and style?) This form of tale that has been circulating for decades, always involving the kidnapping of children from family-type public places such as amusement parks and shopping centers. In the basic form of the legend, a kidnapper snatches a child away from an inattentive parent, drugs it, and hustles it into a restroom; there the abductor performs a quick haircut, dye job, and clothing change on the child to conceal its identity (and sometimes to obscure its gender) and wraps it in blankets before attempting to quickly and quietly spirit the child off the premises. Meanwhile, a vigilant security force has sealed off all the exits, and the attempted kidnapping is thwarted either because the kidnapper realizes he cannot escape undetected and simply abandons his intended victim in the bathroom, or because the child's parent is monitoring the exits (in person or via security cameras) and recognizes the youngster by its distinctive shoes, which the kidnapper has neglected to change or remove. More malevolent versions of this story end not with the thwarting of the abduction attempt, but with the discovery of the child's original clothing on a restroom floor (along with other evidence of what had transpired, such as loose hair, scissors, and a bottle of hair dye). In these versions police tell the victims' parents they are powerless to recover their children (whom they warn are probably already on their way out of the country to be used as unwilling organ donors or sex slaves), and the parents are paid off to keep quiet about the abductions. Often the payoff for the parents' silence is claimed to be something absurdly small in value, such as free passes to the amusement park where the kidnapping took place, yet people continue to take the story at face value. (Would you keep quiet about your child's disappearance for any amount of money, much less something as paltry as a few free tickets?) The tale of the \"haircut-and-dye-job\" kidnappers goes back several decades and is tied to the growth of cities, the movement away from rural areas and small towns, and the increase in the crime rate that occurred in America after World War II. The small-town communities where everyone knew everyone else, outsiders were few, and residents felt safe leaving their doors unlocked at night began to disappear; as people increasingly became part of large, impersonal urban centers, they began to develop fears about the relative anonymity and facelessness of their day-to-day lives. Several of these fears are expressed in this one legend alone: fear of crime and mistrust of strangers (you don't know everyone here; criminals could be anywhere in the crowds you encounter every day, blending in with the masses), lack of faith in the willingness and effectiveness of police protection (the police are \"powerless\" to recover the missing children and therefore don't even try), and distrust of powerful, monolithic corporations (these companies don't care about you or your children; they'll pay you off to make sure you don't dent their enormous profits or ruin their carefully-cultivated family image by blabbing the TRUTH to the media). Even though most versions describe the kidnappers as being caught because of their carelessness, the story still serves its function of providing a vivid cautionary tale to drive home the message that you must carefully keep an eye on your children at all times while out in public: just a few moments' slip-up can lead to disaster. Over the years, this story has been set in virtually every type of locale where families mingle with large numbers of strangers, such as shopping malls, beaches, carnivals, fairs, and amusement parks. Since the details of urban legends tend to gravitate towards the most prominent examples of their kind, this legend has become more and more associated with theme parks such as Disneyland and Canada's Wonderland, and big-box retailers such as Walmart stores, examples of well-known large facilities frequented by families with children and parts of huge corporate enterprises. (In truth, no child has ever been kidnapped from a Disney theme park, and although the abduction and murder of 6-year-old Adam Walsh led Walmart to create its Code Adam protocol for locating missing children in their stores, Adam Walsh actually disappeared from a Sears outlet, and no evidence was found to indicate the abductor had made an effort to alter Adam's appearance.) Sightings: An episode of NBC's Law & Order: SVU (\"Stolen\"; original air date 12 October 2001) opens with a baby girl being kidnapped from a grocery store; the abductor takes her to a bathroom, drugs her, changes her clothes, and cuts her hair. In April 2012, a reporter for a television station in Israel was suspended after running the \"attempted abduction at Disney park\" rumor as a news story. That news outlet was duped by a man claiming to be the father of a 9-year-old girl who went missing at Walt Disney World and was then discovered in one of the park's bathrooms drugged and with her head shaved. <!--

"Barbara Mikkelson" 2001-10-08 "A human penis was found in a jar of fruit punch." "Claim: A human penis was found in a jar of fruit punch. Status: False. Example: [Collected on the Internet, 2001]  Origins: On 2 October 2001, the never-ending stream of rumors arising from the September 11 terrorist attacks on  America was momentarily disrupted by an odd story about a grisly find made by a man imbibing the contents of a bottle of Ora Potency Fruit Punch purchased in Colorado. Juan Sanchez-Marchez said he discovered a penis in his drink after he had downed about two-thirds of the 20-ounce bottle. He called the local police and turned the organ over to them for further investigation. Speculation ran rampant as to the identity of the man the penis the belonged to, what might have happened to him, and how this organ came to find its way into a bottle of fruit drink. (Three Rivers Bottling LLC in New Kensington, the bottling company from which the drink came, uses a high-speed, automated process that would make it next to impossible for anyone to insert something into a bottle on the production line. The drink is sold in clear bottles that are filled, instantly capped and then inspected at the plant. It was thus unlikely any item had been casually dropped into a passing bottle.) The local coroner authorized tests to make sure the find was indeed what it appeared to be: a 3-inch length of human penis, neatly severed at the end. The find prompted the recall of that line of punch by the manufacturer. Production of the beverage was also halted at the bottling plant. Days later the coroner's office announced the gruesome item was actually mold and not human tissue. According to them, the mold likely developed after the metal lid on the fruit punch bottle was tightened improperly, allowing air to seep through the cap. That air and the high sugar content of the drink made for an ideal climate for mold, which probably started growing from the underside of the lid. As initially comforting that change in the status of things might be, further thought reveals that imbibing a liquid that a mold has been growing in isn't all that much of an improvement.

I ask and pray that we all just be very careful! This is practically in our neighborhood and it could happen to any of us, our daughters, or our friends. On Tuesday nite of this week, one of my daughter's friends was driving home on 64W. She is 19 years old. She saw a flashing light behind her and pulled over to the side of the road thinking it was the police. She did not know what she had done wrong, she stopped and turned her car off. The man approached her car and her window was down and she then realized that he was not a police officer. He was a man in his 40's, and he had on a blue mechanic's uniform. He told her to get out of the car. She refused and stated that she needed to use her cell phone to call her parents if something was wrong with her car. He again told her to get out of the car. She refused a second time and he then pulled out a gun and told her to get out of the car. He then told her to walk to his car and get in and she kept saying that she needed to call her parents that they would be worried about her. He then told her that she could not call her parents but he wanted her to go to her car and turn off her cell phone, he still had the gun on her. She went back to her car and turned off her cell phone and thank God above a real policeman came along. The guy then ran and jumped into his car and sped off down the road. The policeman came to see what was wrong and Allison's friend was hysterical. He finally got her to calm down and when he heard what happened he explained to her that this has been happening a lot. He followed her home to her parent's home and she has been emotionally upset and will more than likely need to see a therapist. Please warn your friends, your wife, your children that this is happening here. This incident occurred near the Gaskins Exit on 64W. Please forward this to anyone you would like to know about this to warn their family and loved ones.
 Origins: This missive began winging its way across the Internet in August 2001. Though there have been real (but infrequent) cases of women being pulled over by men they were led to believe were police officers but weren't, this wasn't any of them. The sorry truth came out when police investigated the incident. When pressed by the authorities, the unnamed 19-year-old Richmond, Virginia-area teen admitted inventing the tale for her grandmother's benefit because she had been late getting home. The deception backfired when her concerned grandmother contacted a local television station with the story. Meanwhile, the teen thought to share her false account with a friend, inspiring the mother of that friend to pen the above-quoted warning and send it out via e-mail. Police heard of the thwarted abduction when they were contacted by a reporter and began to receive calls from concerned residents. They expended more than ten hours getting to the bottom of this case. Ultimately, the teen admitted she had made up her story. The young woman won't face any charges because she never filed a report with the police. Barbara \"repeater and the wolf\" Mikkelson Last updated: 6 October 2006

To make a long story short she ended up having to send the steak back 4 times because each time it came back bloody. By the time she had to send it back all those times she was not really hungry, ate a few bites and asked for a doggy bag to take the rest home. Well, she got sick that night. So sick her husband took her to the Emergency Room at Carle. There she had to have her stomach pumped. The doctors asked her where she had eaten, what she had eaten. After telling the doctor, the doctor asked if by chance they brought some home. The husband said yes and went home to get it so they could take tests on it in their lab. After taking the steak to the lab . . . it came back positive with human urine on it! The lady has to have tests every 3-6 months now for disease for the next 6 years! The husband said he would own the restaurant or will put them out of business. They have a big lawsuit going I guess. They are doing DNA on the steak to find out who urinated on it. Oh . . . the restaurant was The Outback in CHAMPAIGN! Isn't that just GROSS! I would be so mad and a lawsuit would not be my stopping point either! Makes you stop and think next time before sending your food back to the kitchen!

  Origins: Urban legends involving adulterated <IMG HEIGHT=179 WIDTH=220 ALT=\"See?\" SRC=\"https://www.snopes.com/uploads/images/horrors/graphics/steak.gif\" ALIGN=RIGHT BORDER=0 HSPACE=16 VSPACE=16> foods used to feature the discovery of worms, disgusting animals, or even human body parts in foods purchased by customers at stores or restaurants, with the offending substance having been included through negligence or a careless lack of cleanliness on the part of the producer or preparer. Now the vogue seems to be the finding of yucky bodily fluids (such as semen) in the remnants of meals consumed by restaurant patrons who have fallen ill, said yucky fluids having been \"placed\" there out of spite by employees whom the customers have managed to annoy or offend. This one fails the credibility test for most of the same reasons as similar tales about hapless customers made sick by the addition of semen to their meals. (Just picture the physician in the emergency room: \"Run this steak down to the lab and have it checked for salmonella, botulism, and e.coli. Oh, and uh . . . just in case, urine.\") The premises just don't ring true — the thought of ingesting urine (or semen) might make someone sick, but urine itself isn't necessarily harmful or toxic. Drinking urine isn't a particularly good idea, but outside of some extraordinary condition (such as an allergic reaction), the notion that someone would become violently ill simply from having eaten a few bites of a steak sprinkled with urine is extremely improbable. The clue to this one is probably given in the first line: \"I want this place to go out of business.\" That's likely an honest motive, accompanied by a disingenuous reason. Unfortunately, the scheme seems to be working on some innocent victims: \"We have received calls asking about the rumor. It's just terrible. We've built a beautiful restaurant in Mankato, and we're absolutely finicky about quality assurance,\" said Siobhan Olson of the public relations office for Timber Lodge. \"These kinds of legends have caused serious damage to a number of companies through the years. The rumors apparently spread rapidly in communities where there's a large university,\" Olson said. \"The rumor has already leaked up to the St. Cloud area.\" She said the persistent and vicious nature of the rumor has already caused a slight decline in business at the Mankato Timber Lodge.1 \"These kinds of legends have caused serious damage to a number of companies through the years.

"Barbara Mikkelson" 2001-09-05 "Drugged travelers awaken in ice-filled bathtubs only to discover one of their kidneys has been harvested by organ thieves." "Late January 1997 saw the e-mailed warning \"Travellers Beware!!\" take the Internet by storm. The story went that a well-financed, highly organized gang operating in various major U.S. cities was drugging business travelers and making off with their kidneys to sell on the organ transplant black market. Very scary stuff indeed. Added to the bottom of what appeared to be the original e-mail were further testimonials from others claiming it was also happening in their part of the country. Breathtakingly frightening, eh? And not a word of truth to it. The majority of people who had this pass through their hands failed to realize this was but an urban legend, an apocryphal tale told and re-told. Moreover, it was an urban legend that had been around at least since 1991. As part of the effort to dispel belief in this nonsense, the National Kidney Foundation has asked any individual who claims to have had his or her kidneys illegally removed to step forward and contact them. So far no one's showed up.
There's a lot more to a successful organ transplant than just stealing what you need from a likely looking victim. The web page put up by <A HREF=\"https://www.transplant-ontario.org/more_news_urban_myth.html\" onMouseOver=\"window.status='Transplant Ontario';return true\" onMouseOut=\"window.status='';return true\" onClick='this.href=\"#ontario\";window.open(\"https://www.transplant-ontario.org/more_news_urban_myth.html\", \"ontario\", \"scrollbars=yes,toolbar=yes,resizable=yes\")'><FONT FACE=\"Arial\">Transplant Ontario</FONT></A> maps out the reasons why a stolen kidney would be unusable.
Folklorist Jan Harold Brunvand mentions in The Baby Train that he first heard this horrific story in early 1991. Very shortly thereafter he was swamped by it coming in from every direction, told as happening in various large cities. In this earlier incarnation, friends discover the victim either in his blood-soaked hotel bed, on the floor, or propped up against the side of a building. It's only at the hospital that the grim \"truth\" of the missing organ becomes known. By 1995-96 a couple of interesting little twists were added to the basic story — the victim was now being left in a bathtub full of ice, the \"friends\" seemingly disappeared, and the \"If you want to live, call 911\" message became firmly woven into the fabric of this tale. The traveler was now clearly on his own, his fate solely in his own hands. (A much scarier story that way, don't you think?) Yet another noteworthy change saw the businessman version of the legend seemingly localize to Las Vegas. No longer told as happening in Your Town, USA, this flavor of the myth appeared to have taken up permanent residence in Sin City, the place where Bad Things Happen To The Unwary (especially \"the unwary\" who were seen as having deservedly brought it upon themselves, married men intent upon getting up to some play-for-pay hanky-panky). In this \"Las Vegas\" version, the man was drugged in his hotel room by the very woman he'd brought up there with him, the ubiquitous Vegas hooker. (A \"college student\" version appeared on the Internet in May 1996. By the fall of that year it had became tangled around both the University of Texas at Austin's newspaper, the Daily Texan and someone who worked there as an administrative assistant who came to be misidentified as the editor of that paper in this much-forwarded e-mail. See our Organ Nicked: Vegetable page for more about this version and how it came to be associated with Kimm Antell. Or click through the denial from the Daily Texan about its ever having run this story.) 1997 saw the \"New Orleans\" version kick-start what had previously been stuck in Las Vegas and re-attribute it to a handful of large cities, New Orleans and Houston among them. Changes to the storyline made the victim more sympathetic by casting him as a weary business traveler who'd paused for a well-earned drink at the end of the day only to be slipped a mickey in the hotel bar. No longer furtively bringing a hooker back to his room for extramarital hijinks but instead sitting peaceably in a public place, his fate becomes that much more terrifying in that by implication we can now see this happening to us. There is no 100% reliable way to pinpoint where an urban legend comes from, what (if any) \"true life\" event kicks it off. Birth records aren't kept for urban legends, and the pursuit of the debunker boils down to working backwards in an attempt to trace the oft-times tenuous, oft-times non-existent, thread from where it now is back to where it once was. All of this is by way of introduction to my theory on the origins of this legend. The plot of the 2 April 1991 episode of the TV show Law and Order (titled \"Sonata for Solo Organ\") featured the theft of a kidney. Law and Order is a story-driven hour-long drama that prides itself in taking its script ideas from real-life contemporary news. In this case, the writer said he'd heard this tale from a friend, and the friend had assured him it came from the pages of a newspaper. Yet no one could find that article. And then I found the following. These horrific claims made by a Turkish man who'd been brought to Britain to sell a kidney were excerpted from a 8 December 1989 Reuters wire report: Kurdish Moslem Ahmet Koc, 34, said through an interpreter he had been lured to Britain last year with the promise of a job by Turkish businessmen who told him he would need a medical check.He went to a hospital which he thought was a hotel and allowed himself to be given an injection which he believed was a blood test. When he came round he was told his appendix had been taken out. It was only three days later that he was told his kidney had been removed and transplanted into another patient in the hospital but that he would be paid a lot of money for it. Well, there's news and there's news. Far from being a victim, Koc was one of a willing consignment of four Turks who sold a kidney that day. The removals/transplants took place in Britain in 1988, and in January 1989 Koc went on record in Turkey with his tale of organ abduction, likely in an effort to get the organ brokers who'd handled his case into trouble with Turkish authorities. (Which he succeeded in doing — one of the two brothers who'd arranged the sale was charged in January 1989 and sentenced to two years in jail in May of that year as a result of Koc's testimony. Koc received a two-year suspended sentence for his part in the illegal sale.) Yet it was not until December 1989 that Koc's concocted story about being an unwitting victim became all the rage in the British press for it was then he was called upon by a General Medical Council's disciplinary hearing to testify in England against the doctors involved. His testimony — which included his horrific tale about waking up dazed and confused in a hospital he thought was a hotel — was widely reported at that time. Justice was eventually served, and Koc's advertisement in a Turkish newspaper offering to sell one of his kidneys came to light. Even so, his story made quite the splash at the time it hit the papers. Consider how you would react to the following, from the 9 December 1989 Daily Telegraph: Mr. Koc said he was taken to the hospital by two brothers, Ata Nur and Tunc Kunter, who have been described to the hearing as kidney brokers. He said he did not see any doctors or nurses when he arrived because he was taken straight into a lift and shown to a luxurious room with a couch, television, wardrobe and bed. \"They drove me to a building which I thought was a hotel. I now know it as the Humana. I had a meal and they (the Kunters) left and I woke up in the morning.\" A woman \"wearing something white like a nurse\" came in and after asking him to sign a document returned with a syringe in her hand. \"I was told they were going to take some more blood from me,\" he said. The next thing he knew was when he awoke in a room with bottles on the wall fixed with cables and he had a very wide bandage around his waist, which was painful. The residue of this December 1989 media splash might well have been what the Law and Order writer's friend remembered. It might also have been what kicked off the story of the unwary traveler, the one about a fella who was lured back to his hotel room and the next day woke up with one less kidney than when he'd started out. Certainly this media circus would have at least set in place the major themes of the legend: the unknowing victim, the hotel room, the waking up in confusion and pain the next day. It takes but little re-working of the details to turn it into a quite recognizable early form of this legend. As mentioned earlier, the legend has changed from its early days and now includes such up-to-date frills as instructions to call 911 and e-mail exhortations to immediately pass this warning along. It's the panic nature of scarelore that speeds it along at such a breathtaking rate — though a story about a dog and peanut butter might shock one into wondering what this world is coming to, it just doesn't bring with it the same compelling incentive to protect those you care about by getting this information to them right away. As such, dog-and-peanut-butter stories get told (or e-mailed) when one has the time . . . whereas when it's scarelore one makes the time. 
This panic-stricken reaction takes its toll, and the 1997 New Orleans romp through cyberspace well demonstrates it. The New Orleans Police Department received more than a hundred calls about this legend. To combat the misinformation they put up a web page specifically denying this rumor, and fielding calls about the \"crisis\" became yet another drain upon their manpower. It's not just the New Orleans Police Department that was driven crazy by the 1997 outbreak. In 11 February 1997 Houston Chronicle article, John Makeig wrote: This message, signed by an Austin man identified as an \"operations engineering manager,\" evidently has been sent via faxes and Internet messages to numerous corporations and organizations nationwide. But, said police and firefighters in Houston and New Orleans, it is utter nonsense. The Austin man, whose name and phone numbers are affixed to the bottom of the \"Travelers Beware!\" message, would certainly agree. Call his number nowadays and you'll get this recorded message: \"If you're calling about the story on the Internet, I did not place it.\" The best explanation we can offer as to why this bit of scarelore has gained, and kept, its popularity, has to do with the growing familiarity of the general population with organ transplants. As these procedures have become more a part of the world we live in, so has awareness of the problems associated to them. The stark reality is that there are more people in need of transplantable organs than there are organs to go around. Knowing that, it's reasonable to believe wild stories of kidneys being hijacked from the unwary. Standing in the shoes of someone desperate for this procedure, wouldn't you be willing to pay just about anything to secure what you needed to keep on living? And if you were willing to pay whatever it cost, wouldn't it be reasonable to believe that an entire class of criminals exists just to service this lucrative business? As many urban legends do, this one plays upon our fears. Fear of travelling to distant cities and thus being out of our element. Fear of being ill and desperate. And, most of all, fear of becoming the victim of random crime. We picture that man waking up in a bathtub filled with ice, and we see ourselves in his place. It's not a nice picture. Update: In 1995, India's parliament passed a bill limiting organ donations to close relatives and imposing prison terms of up to seven years for selling an organ. But in Uttar Pradesh and a string of other states where the law has not been ratified by state legislatures, middlemen continue to track poor people in need of quick money and coax them to operating tables. In such instances, these paid donors receive about $1,000, more than a year's salary for a rural Indian laborer. Those receiving the stolen kidneys typically pay about $6,000 to $10,000 for the organ and the transplant operation. Still, news accounts from India occasionally surface reporting claims that doctors have been arrested for stealing kidneys (either through trickery or force) from unsuspecting citizens. Such claims are difficult to evaluate given the typical lack of any follow-ups in the Western press, but other sources suggest the usual result is that charges are dropped or reduced when investigations determine that the claimants entered into voluntary agreements to sell their kidneys (and later leveled criminal accusations because they regretted their decisions or were disgruntled with the size of the payments they had received). In May 1998 three surgeons and seven others at the Noida Medicare Center in Uttar Pradesh, India were arrested for tricking indigents out of their kidneys. According to charges made against them, members of this group approached various unemployed men, holding out the promise of jobs and offering to connect them with those doing the hiring. Victims were advised that a medical examination was required; they submitted and then were told something correctable by a small operation had turned up in the exam. During the operation and unknown to the patients, one of their kidneys would be removed for resale. Afterwards, nothing further would come of the job offer. In January 2008, several people were arrested in the Indian city of Gurgaon for allegedly luring hundreds of laborers to an underground medical facility in that area by promising them jobs, then duping or forcing them into \"donating\" their kidneys for transplant into wealthy clients. However, police later determined that the primary complainant's kidneys were both intact. <FONT COLOR=\"\" class=\"copyright_text_color\" FACE=\"\" class=\"sect_font_style\"><B>Additional information:</B></FONT> <TABLE CELLSPACING=16 BORDER=0> <TR><TD> &nbsp; &nbsp; <a HREF=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20010420012338/https://www.unos.org/newsroom/archive_statement_022197.htm\" onMouseOver=\"window.status='Debunking the Kidney Heist Hoax';return true\" onMouseOut=\"window.status='';return true\" TARGET=unos><IMG WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=40 ALT=\"Debunking the Kidney Heist Hoax\" SRC=\"https://www.snopes.com/content/themes/snopes/assets/images/common/page.gif\" ALIGN=ABSMIDDLE BORDER=0></A></TD> <TD><FONT COLOR=#FF0000 FACE=\"\" class=\"main_font_style\" SIZE=3> &nbsp; Debunking the Kidney Heist Hoax &nbsp; (<I>United Network for Organ Sharing<I>)</FONT></TD></TR> <TR><TD> &nbsp; &nbsp; <a HREF=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20000817190904/https://www.unos.org/newsroom/archive_story_19990820_urbanmyth.htm\" onMouseOver=\"window.status='Organ Donation Hurt by Story of Kidney Heist';return true\" onMouseOut=\"window.status='';return true\" TARGET=unos><IMG WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=40 ALT=\"Organ Donation Hurt by Story of Kidney Heist\" SRC=\"https://www.snopes.com/content/themes/snopes/assets/images/common/page.gif\" ALIGN=ABSMIDDLE BORDER=0></A></TD> <TD><FONT COLOR=#FF0000 FACE=\"\" class=\"main_font_style\" SIZE=3> &nbsp; Organ Donation Hurt by Story of Kidney Heist &nbsp; (<I>United Network for Organ Sharing<I>)</FONT></TD></TR> </TABLE> Sightings: In an episode of the television drama Law & Order (\"Sonata for Solo Organ,\" original air date 2 April 1991, police in Central Park discover a man whose kidney had been removed without his knowledge:  In that same episode, a doctor explains to detectives why a purloined kidney is of no use in the United States:  This legend also shows up as the plot of the 1993 movie The Harvest. You'll also find it in the 1998 Will Christopher Baer novel Kiss Me, Judas, and it makes a gruesome appearance in the 1998 slasher classic Urban Legend. The 2001 film Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back includes a sequence during which one of the lead characters dreams he wakes up in a tub of ice after selling one of his kidneys. The 6 February 2006 episode of the TV series Las Vegas (titled \"Urban Legends\") references this legend when Danny and Mike enter one of the Montecito's hotel rooms to discover a man missing a kidney lying in a bathtub full of ice. <DT><NOBR> &nbsp; &nbsp; Fletcher, David. &nbsp; \"Turk 'Lost Kidney in Hospital He Thought Was Hotel.'\"</NOBR></DT> <DD><NOBR> &nbsp; &nbsp; <I>The Daily Telegraph.</I> &nbsp; 9 December 1989 &nbsp; (p. 3).</NOBR></DD> <DT><NOBR> &nbsp; &nbsp; Halpin, Tony. &nbsp; \"Transplant Surgeons 'Stole My Kidney.'\"</NOBR></DT> <DD><NOBR> &nbsp; &nbsp; <I>Press Association Newsfile.</I> &nbsp; 8 December 1989.</NOBR></DD> <DT><NOBR> &nbsp; &nbsp; Helm, Hunt. &nbsp; \"'Cash-For-Kidneys' Uproar Hits Humana Hospital in England.\"</NOBR></DT> <DD><NOBR> &nbsp; &nbsp; <I>The Courier-Journal.</I> &nbsp; 4 February 1989 &nbsp; (p.

"Barbara Mikkelson" 2001-06-10 "Spark from a welding arc reaches disposable lighter in worker's pocket, causing it to explode and kill him." "Claim: Spark from a welding arc reaches disposable lighter in worker's pocket, causing it to explode and kill him. FALSE Example: [Morgan and Tucker, 1987]  Recently on a neighboring railroad, two Mechanical employees were killed as a result of butane cigarette lighters exploding. In both cases the men were involved in welding or burning, and sparks penetrated the plastic housing of the lighter, causing the liquid butane to explode with the equivalent of three sticks of dynamite. Therefore, all employees involved in welding, cutting and grinding operations should immediately discontinue use of liquid butane lighters while on duty.

 Variations:   Origins: The exploding lighter legend emerged in the late 1970s. According to Morgan and Tucker, it probably began as a word-of-mouth rumor which, whatever its origins, was \"soon picked up by worried officials and spread further with the help of copy machines.\" Photocopied fliers alerting industrial workers to this \"DEADLY HAZARD\" circulated widely. They claimed, without crediting a source, that a butane lighter could explode with the force of three sticks of dynamite. In one popular version, two welders working for the Union Pacific Railroad were said to have carried disposable  butane lighters in their pockets; the lighters were ignited by sparks from a welding torch and exploded. By November 1979, Union Pacific Railroad had fielded hundreds of calls from reporters and concerned foremen about these supposed horrific accidents, and it issued a press release about the rumor. In it, Union Pacific's safety director was quoted as saying: \"It just didn't happen. Union Pacific certainly doesn't endorse butane lighters, or any other product, for that matter. But we are deeply concerned when our name is used in such a reckless story.\" No welders working for Pacific Railroad or any other employer had been killed by exploding lighters, nor have any been killed in the years since the rumor's appearance. Yet even though the \"welders killed by an exploding lighter\" legend isn't true, it does not necessarily follow that butane lighters are completely safe and will never explode. In the legend, all it takes is an errant spark to set them off, but the chilling reality is that even well-constructed disposable lighters can, and have, blown up when left in too warm an environment. Leaving a lighter in a sunlit car or merely walking around with one in a pocket during a heatwave can be all it takes to turn a 99¢ convenience item into an explosion. Heat-induced pressure builds up inside, eventually creating too much force to be contained by the materials used in the lighter's housing. Some of these lighters have exploded in the pockets of jackets and shirts or gone bang! while lying on the dashboards of cars. There's a great deal to what might otherwise be seen as a baseless \"new technology is dangerous\" rumor, as disposable lighters have exploded with alarming frequency. In 1995 a salesman's car burst into flames in Brussels when the liquid gas in 500 cigarette lighters exploded in the hot sun. That same year, who-knows-what sort of disaster was narrowly averted when one of a bagful of lighters a New York man was carrying onto a flight headed for the Dominican Republic blew up. Luckily, the bag had yet to be loaded onto the aircraft. The man was charged with first-degree reckless endangerment. Scare stories are used to emphasize what are seen as important cautions. In this case, the caution against disposable lighters is driven home by the horrifying mental image of a man turned into a human fireball by such a mishap. His gruesome death is held up as an example of what might happen to you. Usually such tales are either outright fabrications or, when the \"threats\" have something to them, nothing more than exaggerations, with the warned-against activity consummated in the gore-dripped death of a foolhardy soul who engaged in the practice being decried. In those instances, even when the danger is real, the outcome as expressed in the story is not: The lurking menace is presented as a killer in order to make a point, not because such deaths have actually occurred. Yet that is not quite the case here. A number of injuries have been caused by exploding disposable lighters, as well as, it appears, at least one death. In 1985, 66-year-old Ethel L. Smith of Pennsylvania died from injuries sustained, it was asserted, when a Bic butane lighter exploded in her hands while she was using it to light her cigarette, and her estate sued Bic for $11 million. The disposition of the case is unknown. (Bic is known for resolving lawsuits against it out of court and, as part of the settlements, insisting the plaintiffs agree to refrain from discussing their cases. Information is thus very hard to come by about the lawsuits said to have been brought against Bic over the years, including whether plaintiffs were ultimately able to prove their loved ones had died as a result of what they'd claimed.) Noted folklorist Jan Brunvand concluded that the folk version of the disposable lighter accident involving welders was untrue but the actual danger presented by the lighters was real. \"The folk stories got the details wrong, but preserved the memories of such accidents that out-of-court settlements have suppressed for years.\" Barbara \"careful; your Bic may flick you\" Mikkelson Last updated: 27 March 2011

"Barbara Mikkelson" 2001-05-21 "A girl on an amusement park ride was scalped when her hair got caught in the attraction's machinery." "Amusement parks are supposed to be carefree, fun-filled environments folks visit when looking for a thrilling yet safe experience. Attractions are designed to chill and terrify even the most stalwart of souls yet do so with every care having been taken to prevent riders from coming to harm. Or at least that's the way it should work. But it doesn't always. Sadly, the basic thrust of the legend — that a child was scalped by an amusement ride — is true. On 14 September 1996, 8-year-old Danielle Foti and her friend, Valentina Espinola, were celebrating their eighth birthdays with a visit to Bonkers 19 indoor amusement park at the Harborlight Mall in Weymouth, Massachusetts. Part of the fun was to be a ride on the Mini-Himalaya, a sled-like carousel ride. Danielle's hair slipped through a one-inch gap between the back of her seat and the cover on the motor. It wound around a motor shaft spinning at 1,745 revolutions per minute, reeling in her head with such force that it smashed the back of her fiberglass seat. A piece of her scalp was caught in the motor. (A manufacturer of the rides has said the gap should not exist, that the motor cover should be flush with the back of the seat.) Danielle has undergone four bouts of reconstructive surgery, and in 1998 she was awarded $7.5 million in an out-of-court settlement. The amusement park where she was injured closed shortly after the accident, never to reopen. What puts this real-life accident within the realm of lore is how the incident is now remembered. As shown by the examples quoted above, people recall it having happened at a number of different parks and having involved a high-speed, high-drop thrill ride, or at least a ride in which height played a significant factor (such as a ferris wheel). In such scenarios, the horrifying event would not only have been public, but the victim would have been hung in the air for all to see. However, the Mini Himalaya cannot by any stretch of the imagination be considered a \"thrill ride,\" as the following photograph shows. Indeed, it's classified as a \"kiddie ride\" by those who operate amusement parks:  A deadly incident (albeit one involving a maintenance worker rather than a passenger) occurred on 16 August 2003, when 40-year-old carnival worker Doug McKay was killed at the Whidbey Island County Fair (about 30 miles northwest of Seattle) after being dragged by a doughnut-shaped Super Loop 2 roller coaster while spraying lubricant on the tracks. The coaster pulled McKay between 25 and 40 feet into the air (reportedly scalping him in the process), and dropped him back-first onto a fence, killing him. We include mention of it here because sheriff's deputies originally reported McKay's long hair was caught in the ride. Later reports agreed that he had been trapped by his arm. An 11-year-old girl named Elizabeth Gilreath was critically injured in May 2016, when her long hair was caught in the machinery of a \"King's Crown\" ride during a Cinco de Mayo festival in Omaha, Nebraska: \"I just wanted to get to my daughter. I wanted to know she was okay and that she was taken care of well\" Cooksey said. \"I wouldn’t recommend any parent to put their child on a carnival ride.\" The carnival told ABC News in a statement, \"Thomas D. Thomas Shows values the safety and health of our guests above all else, and we are saddened by this accident.\" Elizabeth suffered a skull fracture as well as having her hair ripped out, but doctors are optimistic that she will make a full recovery. Accidents at amusement parks are nothing new. As safe as we want to believe these sites are, they have been the scenes of injury and death. Tragedies like these stay in people's minds, however, due to the nature of the injury — we view scalping as especially horrific. That such a gruesome event could take place in a venue so strongly associated with fun and happy times is the ultimate in ironic juxtaposition.

Real-life incident, or more Internet scaremongering?" "Barbara Mikkelson" 2001-05-21 "A man was blinded for life when his contact lenses fused to his eyes while he was barbecuing." "Claim: A man was blinded for life when his contact lenses fused to his eyes while he was barbecuing. FALSE Examples:  A 21 year old girl had worn a pair of contact lenses during a barbecue party. While barbecuing she stared at the fire charcoals continuously for 2-3 minutes. After a few minutes, She started to scream for help and moved rapidly, jumping up and down. No one in the party knew why she was doing this. Then she was admitted into the hospital, and the doctor said she'll be blind permanently because of the contact lenses that she had worn.  Contact lenses are made by plastics, and the heat from the charcoal melted her contact lenses. DO NOT WEAR CONTACT LENSES WHERE OVERHEATING and FLAMES are concerned or while COOKING!
 
 [Brunvand, 1987] An electrical worker, wearing contact lenses, throws a faulty switch. The result is an arc that generates microwaves, instantly drying up the fluid in his eyes and bonding the lenses to his corneas. The worker tries to take out the contacts, but the corneas come with them, and he is blinded for life. A welder, also wearing contacts, opens his face shield and accidentally touches his welding rod to the metal he is working on. The result is a similar arc, with the same disastrous results.
 
 [Collected on the Internet, 1994] In my chemistry lab, we had to sign a form saying we won't wear contact lenses in the lab. According to the lab professor, a student was wearing soft contact lenses and working with formaldehyde. He went home and took out his contact lenses because they were hurting his eyes. The formaldehyde had seeped in through the gas-porous lenses and glued them to his eyes. He ended up pulling out his cornea.
 
 [Brunvand, 1987] About six years ago when I was shopping for a sun lamp, the appliance salesman emphasized the reliable timer on one model. Then he recounted as a fact that a woman using a lesser product fell asleep and had her contact lenses fused to her eyeballs.
 
 [Collected via e-mail, October 2009] A 21 year old guy, he used to wear a pair of contact lenses, during a barbecue party.

 Origins: It's a rare contact lens wearer who has never experienced at least a few fleeting moments of anxiety when removing his lenses. Fishing about in one's eye after a <IMG HSPACE=16 VSPACE=16 WIDTH=166 HEIGHT=225 ALT=\"Cornea\" SRC=\"https://www.snopes.com/uploads/images/horrors/graphics/cornea.jpg\" BORDER=1 ALIGN=RIGHT> stubborn lens raises momentary concerns that maybe one of these days that little bit of technological wizardry will become well and truly stuck there, forever bonded to the eyeball. Thought is also given to the possibility that you might inadvertently pull out your cornea instead of the lens that sits upon it. It's those irrational fears these legends speak to; we worry that no matter how well the technology has worked for others, one of these days it's going to fail for us and we will, in effect, pull our eyes out. When held up to the light and examined, those anxieties seems pretty baseless. But fearful creatures that we are, we're seldom content to leave well enough alone — we have apprehensions that need to be expressed, no matter how silly they are. Misgivings are thus aired through a series of contact lens mishap legends governed by seemingly plausible scenarios wherein one potentially could tear off one's cornea. The \"freak accident\" element is introduced into the mix, or possibly the \"dangerous chemical combination,\" because these work to elevate what was impossible (yet feared) into the realm of the seemingly possible. For many, their first contact with the 'hapless welder' version of the scare came from a badly blurred photocopied memo warning against the dangers of engaging in welding while wearing contact lenses. Often this memo began with the headline \"TWO RECENT INCIDENTS HAVE UNCOVERED A PREVIOUSLY UNKNOWN PHENOMENON OF SERIOUS GRAVITY.\" (Modern versions have replaced welding with barbecuing as the activity fraught with danger for contact wearers.) There were no such incidents demonstrating a \"previously unknown phenomenon of serious gravity\" affecting those who welded or barbecued while wearing contact lenses, but the memo was often taken at face value, even by respected news outlets. The American Academy of Ophthalmology has traced those rumors back as far as 1967, when a worker for Bethlehem Steel and a welder for United Parcel Service were said to be the victims. Not only haven't such accidents happened, nearly every reputable medical and industrial source in the field says they couldn't happen. Dr. Barry M. Weiner, a physician at the University of Maryland Hospital, responded to a local variant of the rumor: \"It is a physical impossibility to dry up the fluid in your eyes. You'd have to stick your head in a blast furnace to do that. And removing your cornea would be like pulling off your ear.\" Yet there may be a grain of truth in the welder story anyway, even if it has been distorted almost beyond recognition. According to the sci.chem FAQ: [A] Bethlehem Steel welder in Baltimore who, on the 26 July 1967, accidentally caused an arc flash that hit his hard contact lens. He waited until the next day to report eyesight problems, and an ophthalmologist found severe ulcerations on his cornea, but attributed the damage to the wearing of the hard lenses for 17-18 hours after the incident. The cornea healed completely in a few days, with no permanent vision loss, and investigators found no link between the damage and the arc flash, but the myth of the welder removing parts of the cornea with the lens, and consequently being permanently blinded, continues. Unlike the legend, the worst of the man's injury came from his not seeking treatment in a timely manner, not the horrific run-in with the arc. The fellow also made a complete recovery — a far cry from the \"blinded for life!\" element of the legend. As for cautions against wearing contacts in a chemical lab environment, these have nothing to do with mysterious gasses bonding the lenses to the corneas (as suggested in one of the examples quoted above) but rather speak to the always-present danger of a chemical splash to the eyes. When such an accident occurs, it is imperative to rinse the substance from the eyes immediately. The presence of contact lenses will interfere with that, sometimes even trapping some of the chemical to the eye under the edge of the lens. Although the case had nothing to do with contact lenses, in January 2014 the New England Journal of Medicine published a clinical report (\"Ocular Manifestation of Electrical Burn\") on an incident in which a 42-year-old California electrician was left legally blind with star-shaped cataracts in his eyes after suffering burns from a 14,000-volt shock to his shoulder:  A 42-year-old male electrician presented to the eye clinic with decreasing vision 4 weeks after an electrical burn of 14,000 V to the left shoulder. His vision in both eyes was limited to perception of hand motions, with an intraocular pressure of 14 mm Hg in each eye. Slit-lamp examination showed bilateral stellate anterior subcapsular opacities of the lens. Dilated funduscopic examination showed scattered cotton-wool spots and bilateral optic-nerve pallor, which was greatest in the left eye. Four months after the injury, the patient underwent cataract extraction and implantation of an intraocular lens, which was followed by improvement in visual acuity to 20/70 in the right eye and 20/400 in the left eye. Two years after the injury, a retinal detachment developed in the left eye, and the patient underwent repair. At a 10-year follow-up visit, the patient's visual acuity was 20/100 in the right eye, but in the left eye he could only count fingers. There was bilateral optic atrophy with widespread macular pigment disruption. Although the patient was legally blind, he was able to read with the use of low-vision aids and was able to independently commute on public transportation. When lenticular opacities are the sole manifestations of electrical injury, cataract extraction is expected to produce a functional outcome. However, with concurrent damage to the optic nerve and retina, complete visual rehabilitation may be limited.
 Sometimes our fear of contact lenses is expressed in a more direct, less technological form: A drunk staggered into a Pennsylvania ER complaining of severe pain while trying to remove his contact lenses. He said that they would come out halfway, but they always popped back in. A nurse tried to help using a suction pump, but without success. Finally, a doctor examined him and discovered that the man did not have his contact lenses in at all. He had been trying to rip out the membrane of his cornea.

What they did take was \"generic white cardboard box filled with greyish-white powder.\" (That at least is the way the police described it.) A spokesman for the Fort Lauderdale police said \"that it looked similar to cocaine and they'd probably thought they'd hit the big time.\" Then Nathan stood in front of the TV cameras and pleaded with the burglars: \"Please return the cremated remains of my sister, Gertrude. She died three years ago.\"Well, the next morning, the bullet-riddled corpse of a drug dealer known as Hoochie Pevens was found on Nathan's doorstep. The cardboard box was there too; about half of Gertrude's ashes remained. And there was this note. It said: \"Hoochie sold us the bogus blow, so we wasted Hoochie. Sorry we snorted your sister. No hard feelings. Have a nice day.\" <span class=\"copyright_text_color_g\"><b>Origins:</b></span> The saga of Nathan Radlich's cremated sister's remains provides an interesting illustration of the difference between a legend and a news story. On 13 May 1993, thieves broke into the Radlich home in Boynton Beach, Florida, and made off with a cellophane-wrapped package of greyish-white powder that had been kept in a fishing tackle box at the head of the homeowner's bed. Radlich's television, VCR, radio, and watch were left undisturbed by the intruders — all they appeared to have wanted was the contents of that tackle box. Detectives working the case stated they had an awful feeling about why the ashes were stolen: they suspected the powder had been mistaken for cocaine. And there matters rest. In the real life tale, there was no bullet-riddled corpse turning up on Nathan's doorstep, no explanatory note left by the disappointed drug buyers. Even the bit about Radlich appealing on TV for the return of his sister's cremains was manufactured to make a better tale. Well, at least were the cremains lifted because someone was fool enough to mistake them for cocaine? Barring the burglars someday stepping forward to explain the whys of their theft, we'll never know. Speculation on the part of the detectives is just that — speculation. Maybe the ashes were taken by a relative or friend who felt Gertrude deserved a better final resting place than a tackle box. Maybe they were lifted by someone curious about the nature of cremains, or by someone who for his own creepy reasons wanted to have a box of someone's ashes. Seven years later, a news story from the United Kingdom about a break-in there gave far greater reason to believe in the specter of cocaine-snorting thieves mistaking cremains for blow. In a pot on the mantle of her Chadwell Heath, Essex, home, Dee Blyth had kept the ashes of her beloved Labrador. That pot was inscribed with the dog's name: Charlie. Blyth's home was burgled in October 2000. She had been relieved of two television sets, a VCR, a stereo, and gems worth £2,000. During the course of the investigation, constables assigned to the case discovered the jar of doggie ashes had been tampered with. A constable called to probe the break-in fell to laughing upon finding some of the cremains laid out in cocaine-style lines. Clearly, the intrepid thieves had thought they'd hit the mother lode with this jar labeled 'Charlie' (Brit slang for cocaine, so we're told) and had decided to help themselves to a little toot before leaving. We've no idea how high snorting dead dog made them. In January 2011 something similar happened at a residence in Silver Springs, Florida, where a home was burgled of electronics and jewelry, plus the ashes of the homeowner's late father and the ashes of her two Great Danes. During the investigation, detectives learned that the ashes were taken because the suspects mistook the cremains for either cocaine or heroin and that the suspects snorted some of the ashes believing they were snorting cocaine. Could any reasonable person mistake cremains for cocaine? We don't think so, thus we're strongly tempted to dismiss all such tales as just being too far-fetched to have anything to them. But then, there are no limits to human stupidity, as the snorted dog stories above show. In July 2013, human cremains in Tennessee were burgled by a man who thought they were cocaine, but they were not ingested by the thief. 28-year-old Billy Cantrell made off with a bag of human ashes and an Xbox from a neighbor's home, but according to his grandmother, the original tie was still on the bag of the neighbor's mother's cremated remains when it was recovered. Further, \"On the top of it, it had a white piece of paper taped over it with date of birth, date of death, name and the funeral home,\" said the burglar's grandmother. In August 2014, a Vietnam veteran in Alabama reported that a burglar who had broken into his home had smoked his dead wife's ashes, perhaps believing them to be cocaine. The burglar, he said, had taken the ashes from a small plastic box on the headboard of his bed and smoked them with a homemade pipe. Despite what one might envision from hearing the term \"ashes,\" human cremains are neither feathery little wisps akin to ash that might conceivably have blown from a campfire, nor an incredibly fine powder that could reasonably be mistaken for an illegal substance. Cremains vary in color from a gray-and-white mixture right down to a dark gray (charcoal), with unburnt trabecular bone (bone with an internal latticework) showing up yellow. If zinc had been used in the construction of the coffin, some of the cremains might appear slightly yellowed; if iron, green; if copper, pink. Metals in jewelry can also affect the color of the ash. Consistency is the major factor to consider though. Unprocessed cremains are made up of bone fragments, with the resultant residue looking for all the world like used kitty litter of the gravel (not the clumping) type. This is neither a feathery ash nor a fine powder; what's left is a gravel, a substance very few would mistake for a snortable drug. In the U.S., cremains destined for urns are generally left unprocessed. However, if a loved one expresses a desire to scatter these mortal leavings, the question of processing might well be raised by the funeral director. Processing involves the pulverization of the gravelly residue which otherwise would contain quite recognizable fragments of bone. At one time this rendering was accomplished by passing cremains through a hand-cranked laboratory grinder. Modern crematoriums use electric processors to achieve the same end, a fine granular substance. Though this more closely resembles a drug than does gray/white gravel, once again would anyone familiar with cocaine (a powder) mistake a granulated product (something that resembles sugar) for it? We think not, but then we've never been tempted to snort dead dog. In case anyone was wondering, the average man renders out to 7.4 pounds of cremains and the average woman 5.8 pounds. The minimum recommended urn size is 175-cubic-inches, with urns topping out at 300-cubic-inches. \"Cremains mistaken for illegal drugs\" is a recurring theme in contemporary lore. A friend of a friend worked as an airline pilot and for years flew the JFK-Heathrow run. There were many amusing incidents, but one still makes him chuckle the most. He'd flown a jumbo into London, and when all the passengers had disembarked, one of the stewardesses found a small carved box under a seat. When she opened it, she found some suspicious-looking powder inside. Customs staff specially trained to deal with drug trafficking quickly arrived and one officer opened the box, licking his finger before dipping it into the powder and putting it into his mouth to taste it. \"Well, it's not a narcotic,\" he said, efficiently. Just then, an elderly lady tottered along the aisle and asked the stewardess if she'd happened to come across a small engraved casket. It apparently contained her husband's ashes.

"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/death-of-houdini/" "unproven" "Nearly everyone familiar with world-famous magician and escape artist Harry Houdini, no matter how little they know about his life, knows one thing about his death." "David Mikkelson" 2001-05-02 "Escape artist Harry Houdini died from a ruptured appendix caused by his being punched in the stomach." "Nearly everyone familiar with world-famous magician and escape artist Harry Houdini, no matter how little they know about his life, knows one thing about his death: That a boastful Houdini died from trying to impress some college students with his toughness. As legend has it, Houdini was fond of explaining to his fans that by tightening his abdominal muscles he could withstand the hardest punches to the midsection a man could deliver, and one day a college student who was present when Houdini repeated his boast decided to test the claim by raining blows to the magician's midriff. The stomach punches caught Houdini by surprise before he had time to prepare himself, however, resulting in a trauma that ruptured his appendix and ultimately caused his death a few weeks later. Although some of the basic facts of this narrative are correct, its assumption of the cause and effect that led to Houdini's untimely demise likely is not. The chain of events leading up to Houdini's final passing began in mid-October 1926, while he was undertaking a series of shows in the northeastern part of North America. Despite having broken his ankle while performing his famous Water-Torture Cell escape in Albany several days earlier, Houdini, ever the trouper, kept his engagement at the Princess Theater in Montreal and opened there on 18 October 1926. The following day Houdini delivered a lecture at McGill University about exposing fraudulent spiritualists and mediums, and afterwards he stayed around to chat with various faculty members and students. A student named Samuel J. Smilovitch approached Houdini with a sketch he'd made of the escape artist; Houdini was impressed with the drawing and invited the young man to come backstage after one of his shows and do a full portrait. Smilovitch took Houdini up on his offer, bringing along his friend Jack Price to meet the magician in the lobby of the Princess Theater the morning of Friday, 22 October. They followed Houdini to his dressing room, and a few minutes later another McGill student named Joselyn Gordon Whitehead knocked on the door. What then occurred was later described by Jack Price and included in a book by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle: Houdini was facing us and lying down on a couch at the time reading some mail, his right side nearest us. This first-year student [Whitehead] engaged Houdini more or less continually whilst my friend Mr. Smilovitch continued to sketch Houdini. This student was the first to raise the question of Houdini's strength. My friend and I were not so much interested in his strength as we were in his mental acuteness, his skill, his beliefs, and his personal experiences. Houdini stated that he had extraordinary muscles in his forearms, in his shoulders and in his back, and he asked all of us present to feel them, which we did. The first-year McGill student asked Houdini whether it was true that punches in the stomach did not hurt him. Houdini remarked rather unenthusiastically that his stomach could resist much, though he did not speak of it in superlative terms. Thereupon he gave Houdini some very hammer-like blows below the belt, first securing Houdini's permission to strike him. Houdini was reclining at the time with his right side nearest Whitehead, and the said student was more or less bending over him. These blows fell on that part of the stomach to the right of the navel, and were struck on the side nearest to us, which was in fact Houdini's right side; I do not remember exactly how many blows were struck. I am certain, however, of at least four very hard and severe body blows, because at the end of the second or third blow I verbally protested against this sudden onslaught on the part of this first-year student, using the words, \"Hey there. You must be crazy, what are you doing?\" or words to that effect, but Whitehead continued striking Houdini with all his strength. Houdini stopped him suddenly in the midst of a punch, with a gesture that he had had enough. At the time Whitehead was striking Houdini, the latter looked as though he was in extreme pain and winced as each blow was struck. Houdini immediately after stated that he had had no opportunity to prepare himself against the blows, as he did not think that Whitehead would strike him as suddenly as he did and with such force, but that he would have been in a better position to prepare for the blows if he had risen from his couch for this purpose, but the injury to his foot prevented him from getting about rapidly. Despite Price's first-hand account, much dispute remains over exactly what took place in Houdini's dressing room that day. Houdini's wife Bess, a nurse named Sophie Rosenblatt, and Bess's niece Julia Sawyer were also present, and the details of their stories differ. Did Joselyn Whitehead really show up after Smilovitch and Price arrived, or had Smilovitch brought him along? Was Whitehead really a McGill student, or was he an amateur boxer (or both)? Was he already known to Houdini (as he presumably was if, as some rumors report, he had shown up to return some books he had borrowed from the magician). Did Whitehead really \"secure Houdini's permission\" before delivering blows to the magician's stomach, or did he mistake Houdini's casual response to his query as permission to proceed and strike before Houdini was prepared? Did Houdini even really boast that he could withstand such punches? Whatever happened, Houdini was definitely suffering from severe stomach pains by mid-afternoon, although he carried on with that evening's show and two more performances the next day. On the train to Detroit (where Houdini was scheduled to begin a two-week run of performances the following day) he was suffering mightily from the pain in his stomach, so a worried Bess telegraphed ahead and arranged for a doctor to be standing by at their hotel when they arrived. Unfortunately, their train was late, and the Houdinis thus had no time to check into their hotel and headed straight for the theatre instead. The doctor finally caught up with Houdini at the theatre, examined him in the dressing room, found him to be running a fever of 104°F, diagnosed acute appendicitis, and proclaimed that Houdini should be taken straight to a hospital by ambulance. Bess allegedly did not hear the doctor's diagnosis, and Houdini supposedly told the worried theater owner, prophetically, \"I'll do this show if it's my last.\" Houdini rushed through his show and clearly was not performing well; before the third act began he finally decided that he could not carry on by himself and had his assistants finish some of his tricks for him. (Houdini did not collapse on stage, as is often reported, nor did he have to be rescued from the Water-Torture cell by an axe-wielding assistant, as portrayed in various film biographies.) Even then, Houdini would still not seek medical treatment, returning to his hotel before finally Bess \"threw a tantrum\" and summoned the hotel physician. The physician called a surgeon, who examined Houdini and told him that he must be hospitalized at once. Still, Houdini demurred, calling his personal physician, Dr. William Stone, back in New York sometime after 3:00 A.M. Only after Houdini and the other doctors had talked to Dr. Stone did Houdini finally relent and agree to be taken to Grace Hospital, where he underwent surgery to remove his appendix that afternoon (Sunday, 24 October). The surgeon who performed the operation found that Houdini's appendix had ruptured and the magician was suffering from peritonitis. The odds of surviving such an infection in the days before antibiotics were small, but Houdini gamely hung on for another four days before undergoing a second operation on Thursday, 28 October. He seemed to be recovering by the next day, but on Saturday his condition worsened, and the renowned magician escape artist passed away the next day at 52. Fittingly, the date was 31 October 1926: Halloween. The official cause of death was listed as diffuse peritonitis (i.e., an infection of the tissue lining the inner wall of the abdomen, typically resulting from an abdominal rupture), with ruptured appendicitis listed as a contributory factor. When the details of Houdini's final weeks became known in the aftermath of his passing, the common assumption took hold that the blows to the right-hand side of his abdomen (the side on which the appendix is located) Houdini had received a few weeks before his death and his ruptured appendix were directly connected: It seemed a logical conclusion at the time, even to some of his doctors, and so the Houdini death legend began. But although we will likely never know precisely what caused the magician's fatal bout of appendicitis, with the advantage of several decades of hindsight we have good reason to be skeptical about that legend. First of all, given the contradictory accounts provided by the persons who were present when Houdini was punched in his dressing room by Gordon Whitehead, it's unclear what injury the magician sustained, and how badly he was hurt (if indeed he was injured at all), by those blows. Second, reported cases in medical literature of appendicitis following blunt abdominal trauma are quite rare, and a 2010 review of such cases noted that there \"has been much debate as to whether acute appendicitis following trauma is coincidental or causal.\" It's possible that the onset of Houdini's appendicitis was the result of his being punched in the stomach, but a direct connection between those two events is far less common or obvious than is widely believed. It's also possible (and perhaps much more likely) that there was a connection between the stomach blows Houdini experienced in his Montreal dressing room and his death from peritonitis a few weeks later, but in a different and more indirect fashion than is commonly assumed. Houdini may have already been suffering from the onset of appendicitis at the time Whitehead punched him and then attributed his subsequent abdominal discomfort to residual pain from those blows, causing him to delay seeking medical treatment for what otherwise would have been a routine case of appendicitis until after the organ had ruptured (producing a fatal case of peritonitis). Had the dressing room incident not occurred, Houdini might have realized the pain he was experiencing was actually a symptom of a serious medical condition and not delayed so long in consulting doctors and undergoing surgery to deal with it. In the (largely fictionalized) 1953 film biopic starring Tony Curtis, Houdini injures himself when he accidentally rams his abdomen into the hilt of a prop sword backstage during a performance, then dies after his injury prevents him from escaping from the Chinese Water Torture Cell in time. Sightings: The 1987 film Planes, Trains and Automobiles includes the following quote: \"Hey you could have killed me by punching me in the stomach like that when I wasn't ready ... that's how Houdini died, ya know.\"" 2001 "May" 5 1920

"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/bloody-mary-story/" "legend" "Will chanting 'Bloody Mary' 13 times in front of a darkened mirror summon a vengeful ghost?" "Barbara Mikkelson" 2001-04-27 "Chanting \"Bloody Mary!\" thirteen times in front of a candlelit mirror will summon a vengeful spirit." "The research into Bloody Mary goes back to 1978, when folklorist Janet Langlois published her essay on the legend. Belief in summoning the mirror-witch was even at that time widespread throughout the U.S. Mary is summoned whenever squealing girls get together for a sleepover, but boys have been known to call on her too. (The 'Bloody Mary' legend was common when I was a kid in the early 1970s. We typically performed the \"ritual\" in bathrooms, because the bathrooms of our suburban homes had large mirrors and were easily darkened even during the day since they had no windows. A familiar 'Bloody Mary' story was one about a girl who supposedly ended her incantation with a spiteful \"I don't believe in Mary Worth,\" then tripped over the doorjamb while exiting the bathroom and broke her hip.) Examples: [Collected on the Internet, 1995] If you go into the bathroom and look into the mirror with the lights off and the room completely black, and then say 'Bloody Mary' thirteen times, a woman will appear and scratch your face up/off. I was told that if you said \"Hell Mary\" seven times in front of a mirror in a dark room, you would see Satan's image in the mirror. The story was embellished further by the teller, who claimed that after three \"Hell Mary\", the mirror turned red, and that after five an unclear face appeared. Here's how I always heard the story. You go into a room with a mirror and turn all the lights off (this works well in a bathroom). You begin, in a whisper, to chant \"bloody mary. bloody mary, Bloody Mary\", as you continue to chant your voice should grow louder and louder into a near scream. While you are chanting you should be spinning around at a medium rate and taking a glimpse in the mirror at each pass. Near the 13th repetition of the words . . . \"she\" should appear and...? A frend of mine said that her roommate tried this and ran out screaming from the bathroom. She was shaking and appeared genuinely terrified and refused to talk about the incident, but those who were around her when she came out noticed that her clenched fingers were covered in blood. Read more scary stories and creepy urban legends. Variations: <img src=\"https://www.snopes.com/uploads/images/horrors/graphics/mary.jpg\" alt=\"Come to me . . .\" width=\"127\" height=\"153\" align=\"RIGHT\" border=\"1\" hspace=\"16\" vspace=\"16\" /> Mary is said to be a witch who was executed a hundred years ago for plying the black arts, or a woman of more modern times who died in a local car accident in which her face was hideously mutilated. Some confuse the mirror witch with Mary I of England, whom history remembers as \"Bloody Mary.\" An expanded version of that confusion has it that this murdering British queen killed young girls so she could bathe in their blood to preserve her youthful appearance. (That legend more properly attaches to Elizabeth Bathory, a Hungarian countess who lived from 1560 to 1614.) Mary I of England (1553-1558) was anything but a famed beauty terrified of losing her looks — she was a matronly, fortyish woman who had about as much sense of style as a dust mop. The idea of her bathing in the blood of slaughtered virgins to preserve her loveliness is ludicrous. She came by the moniker \"Bloody Mary\" because she had a number of Protestants put to death during her reign, as she tried to re-establish Catholicism as the religion of the land after the reigns of her father (Henry VIII, he who married six wives over the course of his lifetime and established himself as the head of a new religion rather than tolerate the Pope's saying he couldn't divorce wife #1 to marry wife #2) and her brother (Edward VI, who ruled after Henry died but passed away himself at the age of 16). Mary was a devoutly religious woman who saw what she was doing as the saving of her subjects' souls from eternal damnation, and in those times — as crazy as this sounds now — the eternal wellbeing of a soul was deemed far more important than the comparatively fleeting life of a person. That bringing the country back to Catholicism would also safeguard her throne was also a major consideration. Mary I was the half sister of Elizabeth I (1558-1603). Both were daughters of Henry VIII, but Mary's mother was Katherine of Aragon and Elizabeth's mother was Anne Boleyn. Elizabeth I became Queen upon Mary's death. During her reign, Elizabeth returned the country to Protestantism and in the process ordered the deaths of at least as many of her subjects as her half-sister did during her time on the throne, yet she earned the sobriquet \"The Virgin Queen\" (she never married) rather than any version of \"Bloody Elizabeth.\" Some muddlings of this \"murdering queen\" variant claim that Mary, Queen of Scots (1542-1567) is the \"bloody Mary\" of mirror summonings. Though this Mary was indeed a vain and foolish woman, history does not know her as a murderous one. (Well, she did have a hand in doing away with a husband. But she didn't go after her subjects en masse, as did Mary I of England.) So, although there was a British queen known as \"Bloody Mary,\" no connection between her and the mirror witch has surfaced, save for their both having the same name. Likewise, the \"Mary Worth\" appellation of the malevolent apparition doesn't appear to be drawn from the lead character of a popular comic strip of the same name. In lore, as elsewhere, coincidences occur. Why would otherwise rational youngsters want to risk setting a murderous spirit on the rampage? Gail de Vos offers the following explanation: So why do children continue to summon Bloody Mary, flirting with danger and possible tragedy? The ages between 9 and 12 are labeled \"the Robinson age\" by psychologists. This is the period when children need to satisfy their craving for excitement by participating in ritual games and playing in the dark. They are constantly looking for a safe way to extract pleasure and release anxiety and fears. It's possible these \"mirror witch\" games have their roots in oldtime divining rituals involving unmarried girls and future husbands. There are a number of variations of these divinations, some involving chanting a rhyme in a darkened room on a special night and then quickly looking in the mirror to catch a glimpse of the bridegroom-to-be. The concept of mirrors as portals between this world and the realm of spirits shows up in other beliefs, namely those surrounding funerals. It was common practice to cover mirrors in a house where a death had occurred until the body was taken for burial. (Back in the days before funeral homes, corpses were washed by the deceased's relatives, dressed in their funeral finery, and laid out in coffins in the front parlor. Consequently, the dead would be in the house for days.) It was believed if the dear departed caught a glimpse of himself in a mirror, his ghost would remain in the house because the mirror would trap his spirit.

"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/swallow-spiders/" "false" "One of the most widely-circulated bits of misinformation to be found on the internet." "David Mikkelson" 2001-04-22 "The average person swallows eight spiders per year." "It's hard enough to avoid those horrible wriggly things while we're awake, and now we have to worry that they're crawling into our mouths while we sleep? Little Miss Muffett was a piker. Fear not. This \"statistic\" average the average person swallowing eight spiders per year was not only made up out of whole cloth, it was invented as an example of the absurd things people will believe simply because they come across them on the Internet. As noted in Scientific American, this claim is highly implausible from a biological standpoint: The myth flies in the face of both spider and human biology, which makes it highly unlikely that a spider would ever end up in your mouth. Three or four spider species live in most North American homes, and they all tend to be found either tending their webs or hunting in nonhuman-infested areas. During their forays, they usually don’t intentionally crawl into a bed because it offers no prey (unless it has bed bugs, in which case that person has bigger problems). Spiders also have no interest in humans. \"Spiders regard us much like they'd regard a big rock,\" says Bill Shear, a biology professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia and former president of the American Arachnological Society. \"We're so large that we're really just part of the landscape.\" More than anything, spiders probably find sleeping humans terrifying. A slumbering person breathes, has a beating heart and perhaps snores — all of which create vibrations that warn spiders of danger. \"Vibrations are a big slice of spiders' sensory universe,\" Crawford explains, \"A sleeping person is not something a spider would willingly approach.\" From the standpoint of human biology, the oral spider myth also seems ridiculous. If someone is sleeping with her mouth open, she's probably snoring — and thus scaring off any eight-legged transgressors. Plus, many people would likely be awakened by the sensation of a spider crawling over their faces and into their mouths. Shear can attest: once, while camping, he awoke to find a daddy longlegs crawling on his face. So how did this claim arise? In a 1993 PC Professional article, columnist Lisa Holst wrote about the ubiquitous lists of \"facts\" that were circulating via e-mail and how readily they were accepted as truthful by gullible recipients. To demonstrate her point, Holst offered her own made-up list of equally ridiculous \"facts,\" among which was the statistic cited above about the average person's swallowing eight spiders per year, which she took from a collection of common misbeliefs printed in a 1954 book on insect folklore. In a delicious irony, Holst's propagation of this false \"fact\" has spurred it into becoming one of the most widely-circulated bits of misinformation to be found on the Internet." 2001 "Apr" 4 1950

"Barbara Mikkelson" 2001-03-27 "Baby left in car by forgetful parent dies." "Claim: Baby left in car by forgetful parent dies. Status: True. Example: [Collected via e-mail, 2000]  The moral, my aunt says, is that if people want to have their careers they should not have children.
 Origins: Some tales you hope turn out to be nothing more than purely legend, horrifying little cautionary fables meant to inspire us to take that little extra bit of care. This is one of those legends. Unfortunately, it's also one that can't be dismissed as mere moralizing and handwaving, because such deaths happen. And they happen often. The sad truth is, babies and little children die of heat stroke from being left in cars far more frequently than any of us would care to believe. Even the most cursory examinations of recent news accounts turns up double handfuls of such tragedies:         More shocking than these accounts is the knowledge that this list represents only a tiny fraction of the infant and toddler deaths that regularly occur from kids being left in cars. In 2002, 30 children died in the United States after being left alone in cars, and in 2001 there were 34 such deaths. A parked car on a warm day can quickly become the last place you'll see your child alive. Some days, it takes only 30 to 45 minutes to kill a little one left inside. And cars heat up quickly — that it's the morning and the sun isn't yet properly heating up the air doesn't delay matters much. Neither will cracking the window a bit, as many a bereaved pet owner will tell you. Sometimes parents deliberately leave their kids in cars, not realizing how dangerous a practice it is and figuring that at the worst, Junior will be a bit bored by the wait or will demand a sippy cup of juice as soon as they return. Some, however, do it as a punishment, seeing the hot car or the restraint of freedom as a form of payback for a child's earlier whining. And then there are those who honestly forget, who in their befuddlement think their wives have the youngsters that morning, or that they've already delivered the tots to their sitters. All of them — the innocent, the unthinking, and the abusive — end up the parents of dead children. When this story circulates as a bit of lore and not as an excerpt from a recent news story, the typical version involves a father who thought he'd left his child at the daycare center. The need to clearly communicate the story's cautionary elements dictates that they not be diluted by any possible confusion about the parent's culpability. \"This could happen to any parent,\" says the legend, \"even the most caring and responsible.\" Thus, the bereaved father needs be portrayed as wholly innocent of any deliberate intent to harm the child, or even of the unintentional neglect of knowingly leaving the youngster in the car. Very few would identify with a video poker addict or a pot smoker whose preoccupation with his own
interests leads to the death of his child. But a great many will identify with the harried or distracted parent who makes a one-time mistake. When the tragic death is cast as wholly accidental, this horrifying outcome is presented as something that could happen to you. One last word of caution: These deaths don't occur just in summer. Courtney Turner died in a car in New Hampshire in March. She'd been left there for all of an hour. Barbara \"baby on board slab\" Mikkelson Last updated: 2 September 2006

"Barbara Mikkelson" 2001-03-26 "Bubble Yum chewing gum contains spider eggs." "Claim: Bubble Yum chewing gum contains spider eggs. Status: False. Example: [Fine, 1992]  Origins: Bubble  Yum was the first soft bubble gum to hit the market, making its debut in 1976. It was an instant success with its target consumer group, kids and teens, and sales of the candy quickly soared to such a level that its manufacturer cut back on advertising in order to allow production to keep pace with demand. By the spring of the following year, the whirlwind early sales had slipped noticeably in the New York area. Rumors that Bubble Yum contained spider's eggs or legs or was made from their webs abounded. (A less well-circulated rumor had it that the confection caused cancer. It too dates from the same time period.) Schoolyard tall tales about a girl waking up with webs all over her face or nine youngsters dying after swallowing the gum spread quickly among kids and were soon taken as gospel. Rather than pretend there wasn't a problem or that it would just go away, the parent company took on the rumors: [Lardner, 1982] But in one bizarre case, the manufacturer felt it had no choice but to put the issue before its customers as conspicuously as possible. The manufacturer was the Life Saver Co., and the problem was an unfounded rumor that spiders' eggs had been found in Bubble Yum, a Life Saver product. The rumor hit just when Bubble Yum was going through \"almost a breakthrough in sales achievements,\" recalled Robert Denny, Life Saver's vice president of product management. Within 10 days, company surveys showed that \"well over half\" of the children in the New York area had heard the rumor, according to Denny, \"and despite recommendations by some public relations people to ignore the rumor and talk about the positive benefits of the product, we chose to run an ad in all the newspapers. \"Somebody is telling very bad lies about a very good product,\" the headline proclaimed. But in one bizarre case, the manufacturer felt it had no choice but to put the issue before its customers
as conspicuously as possible. The manufacturer was the Life Saver Co., and the problem was an unfounded rumor that spiders' eggs had been found in Bubble Yum, a Life Saver product.

 The parent company spent over $100,000 battling this rumor. Full-page ads were run in fifty different newspapers. Confidence in the product was restored, although to this day it's difficult to find anyone who grew up in that era but hadn't heard the rumor bruited about as fact. Where did the rumor come from? Prior to Bubble Yum, bubble gum was hard and took a fair bit of vigorous mastication to render it into a suitably soft bubble-blowing state. Bubble Yum was a breakthrough, a gum that was ready for bubble blowing after being chomped only a few times. As to how soft it was, even a little tyke could squish a block of Bubble Yum between his fingers. Gone were the days of arduous chewing! Any confection that revolutionary is going to spawn speculation among the younger set. (See our \"Death of Little Mikey\" page for the rumor about Pop Rocks.) \"Why is it so chewy?\" was the question on everyone's lips. Why did it (unlike traditional bubble gum) feel a bit slippery in the mouth? It didn't take long for kids to invent a plausible answer. There had to be something slippery in there. What could be more slippery than, say, spider eggs?

"Snopes Staff" 2001-03-25 "A family replaced their neighbor's dead rabbit after mistakenly believing their own dog killed it." "A tale nearly identical in structure to the legend about the dead animal shipped by air freight (which handlers mistakenly thought had died in transit) is the following: A man moves to town and hunts around for an apartment to rent, but he's turned down by most landlords because of his large dog (mastiff, doberman, etc.). He finally secures a carriage house that's in the backyard of a house owned by two old women by assuring the ladies that the dog is perfectly friendly, which, of course, it is. The landladies have a rabbit hutch in the backyard which contains two white rabbits. Months pass, and everyone gets along just fine. The man had trained the dog not to pester the rabbits while he's away at work, and the dog is quite obedient. One night, though, the man returns from a long weekend away on business. His dog is beside itself with joy to see the master return, but it's late, the man is tired, so he plops right down in bed and falls asleep, leaving the dog outside. In the middle of the night the man is woken up by the strange sounds that his dog is making outside the bedroom window, a kind of muffled whimpering. When he opens the front door he sees the dog standing there with one of the rabbits in its mouth! After a quick smack or two on the head the dog drops the rabbit on the ground, and the man immediately picks the bunny up and brings it inside where it's light. The rabbit is brown with dirt but apparently undamaged, so the man rushes to wash it off and dry it. He slips out the door into the dark night, returns the rabbit to the hutch, and brings the dog inside. Thinking the women won't notice, he falls asleep. In the morning, as he's leaving the carriage house for work, he sees the two old ladies standing around the rabbit hutch, which he must pass by on his way out of the backyard. He figures everything's alright and the rabbit is unhurt, but when he walks up and says good morning he notices that the women are completely distraught and crying. In fact, one of the women is making the sign of the cross over and over again. The man knows that he's probably been caught, but he decides to be cagey and asks, \"What happened? Did the rabbits die?\" \"Well, one of them did,\" replies one of the women, \"but we buried him three days ago and now he's back in the hutch!\" Both legends feature persons who, mistakenly believing themselves to be responsible for the death of someone else's pet, try to cover up their culpability by replacing the dead animals — only to find that they have exacerbated an unfortunate situation by substituting a live (or seemingly live) pet in place of one that was already dead.  A reader tried to slip one past \"Dear Abby\" advice columnist Jeanne Phillips by submitting an even more twisted version of this tale to her as a first-person experience in September 2004. To her credit, Ms. Phillips spotted it as an urban legend: DEAR ABBY: Last year, my husband's pet rabbit, \"Blossom,\" died. My husband, \"Edwin,\" went into the back yard one morning and found her dead in her cage. He buried her in our yard. Later that day, our neighbor's dog dug up the rabbit. When the neighbor came home, he found the little body on his doorstep. Thinking his dog had killed Blossom, he panicked. He ran out, bought another rabbit that looked just like Blossom, and placed her in our cage. When Edwin returned from work that night, he was stunned to find the rabbit sitting in its cage and immediately concluded that Blossom had returned from the dead. Ever since, my husband has treated the rabbit like a little deity. He built an altar for her and sits in front of her cage in the lotus position and talks to her. The neighbors have since moved, but last week I ran into the wife and she told me the story. Thinking it might help Edwin, I repeated the story to him. He became irate and accused me of trying to ruin the only miraculous thing that had ever happened to him. Should I insist that Edwin seek counseling, or should I continue to live with this? I really don't know where it will end. - At My Wit's End DEAR WIT'S END: You may not, but I do. It's going to end here and now. According to snopes.com, your rabbit tale is an urban legend, and so old it has whiskers. Thank you for sharing it with me. It's still a thigh-slapper. Variations:
   Sightings: Celebrities' telling the \"hare dryer\" story on The Tonight Show as a personal anecdote has become almost a tradition. In January 1989, Johnny Carson related the story as a true event that had befallen his neighbor. April of that same year found Michael Landon regaling Johnny with the same tale, this time starring Landon himself as the owner of the dog. In June 2000, singer Marc Anthony told Jay Leno the story, swearing the rabbit had been dug up by his father-in-law's dog. In July 2000, William Shatner managed to move the legend to a new late-night talk show by telling host Conan O'Brien the incident had happened to his co-author. We're told a non-talk show sighting of this legend appears in Jeff Foxworthy's 1989 recording, Sold Out, and this tale also formed the plot of an episode of The Chris Isaak Show (\"Crimes and Punishment,\" original air date 26 March 2001). The same story plays out in the 2003 film, Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star." 2001 "Mar" 3 1980

"Barbara Mikkelson" 2001-03-23 "A babysitter quiets her charges by gassing them." "Claim: A babysitter quiets her charges by gassing them. LEGEND Examples:  When our children were young, twenty to twenty-five years ago, a friend was riding on a bus. She was sitting in front of two teen-age girls who were discussing the problems of baby-sitting. When the subject turned to crying babies and how to stop their crying, one girl was overheard to say to the other, \"That's no problem. I just turn on the gas in the oven, put the baby's head in until he falls asleep, and then take it out.\"
 
 [Collected by Baughman, 1953] In New York City you have to be awfully careful about getting baby-sitters. You just don't know what might happen. My sister's girlfriend was sitting in the subway one day when she heard two women discussing the kids they stay with and how they handled them. She heard one of them say, \"I just take them into the kitchen and give them just a l-i-t-t-l-e bit of gas.\"  Origins: The oldest printed references to \"Gassing the kids to quiet them\" tales we know of so far date to the early 1950s, but some of our readers recollect having heard these stories as far back as the 1920s and 1930s. As in several other prominent  urban legends, the biggest parental concern about leaving Junior in the care of another is given voice through this legend: Can that other person really be trusted? Absentee parenthood is cautioned against in this tale, lest it lead to one's own children being left in the care of someone who might either callously or just unknowingly endanger them. In this case, while a whiff of gas might not prove fatal to a hardy infant, just a little bit more and Junior won't ever be waking up from his sleep. Early versions of this legend focus on live-in or steady hired help: the maid, nanny, or housekeeper who is charged with the care of the child on a day-to-day basis. More modern tellings have shifted to the most feared childcare provider of them all, the barely-known teenage
babysitter who is hired for the evening. Almost without fail, the damning admission is overheard on public transportation (a bus, a trolley, or a subway car), a venue that makes it impossible for the eavesdropper to determine where these girls live, let alone whom they work for. The gassing sitters appear just the one
time, then are never seen again. This story is often trotted out by those intent upon stressing the need to properly supervise childcare providers. In 2013, in a possible instance of ostension,
an event somewhat similar to the legend was reported in real life when Tammy Eppley, a childcare worker at a home-based daycare in Westerville, Ohio, was accused of regularly dosing six of her charges with Benadryl, an antihistamine allergy medicine that can leave users drowsy, and Melatonin, a hormone and sleep aid. Eppley has been charged with six misdemeanor counts of endangering children.

"Barbara Mikkelson" 2001-03-22 "Baby left in a high chair to await the coming of the sitter is discovered dead by the vacationing parents when they return weeks later." "Original title: \"High Chair to Heaven\"Very few legends express parental fears about leaving a child with strangers better than this one. The \"dead baby found in a high chair\" legend focuses on the most terrible \"what if?\" of all: What if the person I entrust the child to proves untrustworthy? Examples: [Brunvand, 1993] A young couple were catching a flight to begin a trip of several days, and they had hired a sitter to care for their baby during their absence. When it was time to leave for the airport, the baby sitter had not arrived, so they telephoned her home and learned that she was on her way. They put the baby in its highchair, left the back door open for the sitter, and rushed to the airport. When the sitter arrived, the wind had blown the door shut, and it had locked. She thought the parents either must have taken the baby with them or left it with someone else, so she returned home. When the couple got back, they found their baby starved to death in its highchair. [Collected by Dale, 1984] A Norwegian couple, who had not had a proper holiday for years, decided to treat themselves to a long winter holiday in the sun. At last the great day dawned; everything was packed and loaded into the car — as soon as Nanny arrived they could get away. But today of all days, Nanny was late. At the last minute she phoned and told them that her car had broken down. The man said that if they came to collect her now they would miss their flight; was it too far to walk? Nanny said it wasn't, they could leave and she'd be there in a quarter of an hour. So the wife strapped their young son into his highchair, told him Nanny wouldn't be long, and set off for their island in the sun. During the long, hot weeks away they missed the news that the girl had been hit by a lorry and killed on her way to their house. When at last they returned, sun-bronzed and rejuvenated, they found their starved son still strapped into his chair where they had left him. <img src=\"https://www.snopes.com/uploads/images/horrors/graphics/hi-chair.jpg\" alt=\"Cartoon of the legend\" width=\"206\" height=\"280\" align=\"RIGHT\" border=\"1\" hspace=\"16\" vspace=\"16\" /> Guilt plays a big part in this cautionary tale. In a chillingly unforgettable way, the parents are punished for attempting to take a vacation from being parents. The moral of this tale is \"It's a 24/7 job; there is no time off.\" Did this happen in real life? Oh, probably not. It's hard to conceive of parents who wouldn't call home at least a few times just to reassure themselves that the sitter had found everything she needed and the child hadn't come down with some typical kids' malady or been kidnapped by marauding aliens jetting through on their way to Alpha Centauri. These days parents have a hard time sitting through a movie without calling home — should we really imagine they would go weeks without admonishing Nanny to be certain to use the blue powder and not the yellow on Junior's bottom, never to turn out his nightlight, or to give him his purple dinosaur if he won't settle down for the night? In 2006 a variation on the legend found its way to us: I heard several of my friends talking about a really sad story the other day.They talked about a man that went on tour in Iraq, leaving his wife and 2 children behind. He was quite upset by the fact that he couldn't call them, as his platoon wasn't near any place with phone access. At home, the woman had put her infant son and daughter in a playpen, when she suffered a heart attack and died. The husband found his dead wife and children several months later." 2001 "Mar" 3 1980

"David Mikkelson" 2001-03-17 "A man who died at his office desk went unnoticed by his co-workers for five days." "Claim: A man who died at his office desk went unnoticed by his co-workers for five days. Status: False. Example: [Sunday Mercury, 17 December 2000]  George Turklebaum, 51, who had been employed as a proof-reader at a New York firm for 30 years, had a heart attack in the open-plan office he shared with 23 other workers. He quietly passed away on Monday, but nobody noticed until Saturday morning when an office cleaner asked why he was still working during the weekend. His boss Elliot Wachiaski said: 'George was always the first guy in each morning and the last to leave at night - so no-one found it unusual that he was in the same position all that time and didn't say anything. 'He was always absorbed in his work and kept much to himself.' A post mortem examination revealed that he had been dead for five days after suffering a coronary. Ironically, George was proof-reading manuscripts of medical textbooks when he died.
 Variations: In March 2001, a slightly-rewritten version began circulating on the Internet, this one transforming dear dead George into a geologist working for an oil company in Calgary, Alberta. One especially adorable difference between this version and the earlier incarnation is the closing comment by Turklebaum's boss, Elliot Wachiaski, which attempts to explain why no one noticed Turklebaum's deceasitude: \"Besides he was a geologist, they never really do much anyway.\" Origins: What a fable for our times! Nearly all of us feel we're spending too much time at our jobs, are anonymous cogs in corporate machines whose disappearance (or death) would scarcely be noticed by our co-workers and employers, and are spending our lives at work (literally). So of course people took to the story of dead-but-undiscovered George Turklebaum, which the Birmingham [England] Sunday Mercury claimed to have broken when it reported his death as a \"Crazy Worlds\" item on 17 December 2000 (even though the same item, minus some of the details, had been run by The Guardian and the BBC a few days earlier). The story of Turklebaum's tragic demise was picked up and printed by several other newspapers in Great Britain (including the London Times) in December and January and soon garnered a tremendous amount of attention (especially in Birmingham, Alabama, as confused readers mistakenly bombarded that city's newspapers with queries about Turklebaum). In response to all the inquiries it received, on 28 January 2001 the Sunday Mercury published the following: Well of course the story is true! The Sunday Mercury's Crazy World spots are compiled by journalist Keith Chalkley — a man with a Midas touch for finding strange goings-on in every corner of the globe. Keith said: 'I was first alerted to George's story by a New York radio station I broadcast to. 'But New York police, to whom I spoke, say the case isn't as odd as people might think. 'In 1975, an insurance clerk with a firm in Manhattan died in his workplace — and it was 18 DAYS later that it was found that he was dead.' The Sunday Mercury's Crazy World spots are compiled by journalist Keith Chalkley — a man with a Midas touch for finding strange goings-on in every corner of the globe. Keith said: 'I was first alerted to George's story by a New York radio station I broadcast to. 'But New York police, to whom I spoke, say the case isn't as odd as people might think. 'In 1975, an insurance clerk with a firm in Manhattan died in his workplace — and it was 18 DAYS later that it was found that he was dead.'
 What satisfied the Sunday Mercury didn't satisfy us, and it shouldn't have satisfied anyone else:         This one was a hoax, no matter how the Sunday Mercury tried to spin it. It (and others) got suckered by a 5 December 2000 article from the Weekly World News (a supermarket tabloid), which was almost word-for-word identical with the version the Mercury printed:  (Notice that the Sunday Mercury's follow-up \"This really is true!\" article quotes its \"reporter\" as having spoken to the New York police and been told that \"the case isn't as odd as people might think\" and that \"in 1975, an insurance clerk with a firm in Manhattan died in his workplace — and it was 18 DAYS later that it was found that he was dead\" — information straight from the concluding paragraph of the Weekly World News piece.) The Turklebaum saga is a prime example of why we stress repeatedly that the appearance of a news story in one or more newspapers (even respected publications such as the London Times) is no guarantee of its truthfulness. Extraordinary news requires extraordinary documentation, which is something more than a bevy of newspapers simply running the same unsourced piece. The passing of people who have died at their desks hasn't always been discovered immediately, but at no time has there been a five-day span between death and discovery. In February 2011, Los Angeles County worker Rebecca Wells (51) expired at her desk on a Friday, with her body being discovered on Saturday afternoon by a security guard. In January 2004 several news outlets picked up a similar story from the Finnish tabloid Ilta-Sanomat, which claimed that a tax office official in Finland died at his desk, but his death went unnoticed by up to 30 colleagues for two days. Unlike the passing of Rebecca Wells, that story is unconfirmed. Sightings: A June 2000 Conseco television commercial anticipated (and maybe even have inspired) this fake news story about George Turklebaum. The ad showed an unmoving man wearing sunglasses seated at a desk. Throughout the day various assignments were placed on his desk and then picked up, completed, and dropped back at his desk by co-workers. At the end of the day the wife appears to pick him up. She is complimented on her husband’s diligence and performance, shoos the appreciative co-worker away, closes the door to her husband's office, and begins to prepare him to leave. The voice-over on the commercial comments on how it's important to be prepared for the unexpected, leaving behind the unstated message that otherwise you too might have to day after day prop your dead husband at his desk at work to keep those paychecks coming in.

"Barbara Mikkelson" 2001-03-17 "When the Red Cross conducted a volunteer blood drive at a local high school recently, they uncovered a shocking truth: 20% of the student donors were HIV-positive." "Claim: When the Red Cross conducted a volunteer blood drive at a local high school recently, they uncovered a shocking truth: 20% of the student donors were HIV-positive. Status: False. Example: [Collected by Royko, 1992]  Origins: The rumor of a large number of HIV-positive high school kids having being discovered through the Red Cross' rejection of their blood has been with us since at least 1987, and it has moved around the country at will, attaching itself to whichever high school just hosted a blood drive.  Though its venue changes, the story remains the same — some horrific number of fresh-faced youngsters are discovered to be living under a death sentence. The infected percentage of the student body varies from 10 to 82 depending on who is doing the telling, with 12% (1 in 8) and 20% (1 in 5) the clear front runners. For example (the legend is certainly not limited to these communities), the rumor has raced through Chicago (1992, 20% of the students in one particular high school), Los Angeles (1992, 12%), Dubuque (1996, \"dozens of students\"), Kansas City (1996, 15%), Orlando (1992, \"dozens\"), Seattle (1992, 15%), St. Petersburg (1991, 20%), Orange County, CA (1987, 14%), Sonoma County, CA (82%, 2001). What's the real story here? The American Red Cross began testing blood for HIV in 1985. By 1996 there had been 28 donors confirmed as HIV-positive, out of 1.65 million blood donations nationwide. Only one of those infected was a high school student. End of story. The use of specific numbers in the claim lends the dire tidings more authority, yet they are still hogwash. For instance, with regard to the rumor we quote as our example (Conant High School, blood drawn from 317 seniors,61 tested positive for HIV), we know the real numbers for that school's blood drive: 125 students and 37 faculty members gave blood, and not one of them was HIV-positive. In 1992 in the small Texas town of Bogata, a health worker's announcement that she knew of six cases of AIDS at the small (197 students) Rivercrest High School appeared to confirm the rumor. Dona Atkins (then Dona Spence), a case manager at Ark-Tex Council of Governments, a regional planning agency, said each of the teens came to her for counseling. She never named names or produced the teens but always stood by her story. On the other hand, no confirmation of what she asserted ever emerged, no infected teenagers came forward, none subsequently sickened and died, and the Texas Department of Health reported that its investigation could find no basis for her claims. Moreover, she'd been caught telling untruths before, stating she'd served as an Army nurse for 17 years, including in Vietnam, yet military records showed she wasn't a registered nurse in Texas or California and had two short stints in the military, neither of which were in Vietnam. She would have had a motive for telling a false story; her husband had contracted AIDS from a blood transfusion, and his illness and subsequent demise in 1989 had moved her to speak to teenagers and the community about AIDS prevention. It is not unknown for those who feel their important messages aren't being heard clearly enough to personalize the dangers they warn against by inventing especially tragic victims whose stories they can use to drive home the validity of their admonishments. The heightened sense of awareness among teenagers that AIDS is a real possibility in their lives probably lies at the bottom of this rumor. It is known that HIV is discovered through blood tests, and that the Red Cross runs such tests on all the blood donations it collects. Teen fear plus a blood drive makes this rumor a natural to sweep through a school once the Bloodmobile has driven off down the street. Fears are also likely fed by the sight of school chums being told they can't donate blood. Though potential donors are turned away if they are not feeling well, have slightly elevated temperatures, demonstrate low red cell counts, have recently weathered fevers or colds, have gotten tattoos in the last year, or if it has not been the required 56 days since they last gave blood, none of those explanations are likely to occur to the students who notice that buddies who went to give blood afterwards lack the telltale bandages on their arms. The rumor of the turn-downs being due to AIDS is a tantalizing scenario likely to be spread by impressionable high schoolers. Yet, though superficially plausible, the rationale behind such a whisper is seriously flawed — were someone unknowingly contaminated, said infection wouldn't be discovered until the donated blood was examined back at the lab because there is no way on site to tell whether a person tests positive for HIV. It's possible parents and teachers do their bit to keep this rumor up and running — the use of scare tactics to dissuade young people from engaging in risky behaviors is nothing new. A story of a nearby high school's blood drive turning up so many HIV-positive kids would serve to drive home the message that there's nothing safe about teen sex.

"David Mikkelson" 2001-03-11 "The morning after an all-night drinking binge, a man discovers the body of a little girl embedded in his car's grille." "Claim: The morning after an all-night drinking binge, a man discovers the body of a little girl embedded in his car's grille.  Example: [Ann Landers, 1986]  The next morning he was pulling out of the garage onto the driveway to go to work. His wife ran to the door to give him his lunch, which he had forgotten. She went as far as the porch and fainted. Her husband got out of the car to see what was the matter. He saw an eight-year-old girl imbedded in the grille of his car. He reported himself to the police — said he had a complete blackout, didn't remember anything. He was charged with DWI and a few other things that will keep him in prison for quite some time. Maybe others who drink and drive may decide it's not worth the risk after reading this letter.
 Variations: A less sinister version of this legend involves a (non-drunk) motorist who accidentally hits a cat: A man driving home from work hits a cat crossing the road. Concerned, he pulls up and finds a cat lying in the gutter apparently unconscious. He kills it quickly so it won't suffer and then drives home. When he gets there his wife points out that there is a dead cat wedged behind the front bumper, and at that moment the police arrived to arrest him for killing a cat that has been harmlessly sleeping in the gutter. The horrified owner had watched and taken down his registration number. Origins: The motif of the careless driver who runs into things (including people) without realizing it until someone else points out objects or bodies stuck to his car has generic antecedents in sea tales about equally careless captains whose ships are found to have items such as bodies, wreckage, and parts of other ships entwined in their anchors and rigging. One such version was reported by writer John McPhee as an \"asmut\" (apocryphal story much told) well known among the merchant marines: One such yarn led up to a question that was supposedly put to a merchant skipper when he arrived in port: \"Captain, have you seen any sailboats recently?\" \"No.\" \"Well, you should have. There's a mast and rigging hanging from your anchor.\" \"No.\" \"Well, you should have. There's a mast and rigging hanging from your anchor.\"
 Automobile versions (featuring non-drunk drivers who hit pedestrians or cats) were probably circulating decades before the current form of the drunk driver unaware that he has run over a child. This version of the legend, a cautionary tale about the perils of drinking and driving, took off in 1986, especially after it was given nationwide prominence in Ann Landers' 24 September column that year. With the increased attention brought to bear on the problem of drunk driving in the 1970s and 1980s by organizations such as Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD), the adaptation of a bit of urban folklore into a useful piece of \"scarelore\" is not surprising. Many apocryphal drug horror tales have long served a similar purpose in the campaign against drug abuse. As we often find in tales intended to focus our attention on one of society's lurking dangers, the innocent victim is one chosen to provoke maximum moral outrage: in this case, an eight-year-old girl. Although none of them matches the details of the \"little girl killed by drunk driver\" version of this legend, a number of real-life tragedies have involved motorists who struck and killed people on roadways and (knowingly) continued driving while their cars carried their victims' bodies:     Note that none of the five cases cited above is an example of ostension (the real-life occurrence of events described by a legend), because none involved a driver who struck a live person and then drove off with the body stuck to his car, completely unaware of his having been involved in an accident. One known case apparently involved a completely unaware motorist, although the driver's failure to comprehend he had killed a pedestrian was due to dementia, not excessive drinking. In October 2005, news accounts reported that 93-year-old Ralph Parker was stopped after driving through a toll booth on Florida's Sunshine Skyway when a toll taker noticed a body on the front of his car and alerted police. Parker had struck a 52-year-old pedestrian, severing his leg and killing him, then driven for three miles with the victim's body protruding through his windshield. An official with the state attorney's office said it was unlikely Parker would be prosecuted since he did not appear to know where he was or what had transpired. 
One case that may have involved a drunk, completely unaware motorist occurred in August 2007 when Tony Martinez, a 54-year-old California motorist, pulled out of a parking lot and cut off motorcyclist Nicholas Justin Campbell. Campbell crashed into Martinez's car, with the force of the crash throwing his head and torso broke through the automobile's rear window; Martinez drove away from the scene and did not realize until he arrived home that Campbell's body was hanging out of the back of his car. Martinez then drove to a nearby fire station, where Campbell was pronounced dead. Police arrested Martinez and booked him for gross vehicular manslaughter, hit-and-run, and driving under the influence.

Real medical case or hoax?" "David Mikkelson" 2001-03-04 "The cause of swelling in a girl's jaw was determined to be cockroach eggs she ingested from eating a Taco Bell taco or licking envelopes." "Claim: The cause of swelling in a girl's jaw was determined to be cockroach eggs she ingested from eating a Taco Bell taco or licking envelopes. FALSE Examples: [Collected via the Internet, 1998]  This girl was really in a hurry one day so she just stopped off at a Taco Bell and got a Chicken soft taco and ate it on the way home. Well that night she noticed her jaw was kind of tight and swollen. The next day it was a little worse so she went to her doctor. He said she was just have an allergic reaction to something and gave her some cream to rub on her jaw to help. After a couple of days the swelling had just gotten worse and she could hardly move her jaw. She went back to her doctor to see what was wrong. Her doctor had no idea so he started to run some test. They scrubbed out the inside of her mouth to get tissue samples and they also took some saliva samples. Well they found out what was
wrong. Apparently her chicken soft taco had a pregnant roach in it that she ate!!!! The eggs then some how got into her saliva glands and she was incubating them in her mouth. They had to remove a couple a layers of her inner mouth to get all the eggs out. If they hadn't figured out what was going on the eggs would have hatched inside the lining of her mouth! She's suing Taco Bell! Of course.
 Origins: McDonald's and KFC have long had their special yucky food contamination legends, so it was only a matter of time until Taco Bell got their own. Although informal versions of this wild tale circulated on the Internet as early as March 1998, it was November of that year before the text quoted above made its appearance in inboxes everywhere. Later versions of the e-mail ended with the tagline \"The article can be found in the Nov. 19thNY Times.\" Disabuse yourself of the notion that anything remotely resembling this tale appeared in that publication on that day or any other. (The only roach story in the 19 November 1998 New York Times was a piece by Douglas Martin, titled \"City Said to Use More Pesticides Than Farm Counties.\" It contained no mention of Taco Bell or roaches being found in food and was merely a story about pesticide use in the city and its possible dangers.) We're supposed to take this scary e-mail as yet another warning about the lurking dangers of fast food prepared by faceless automatons working for monolithic corporate chains. To wit, the lack of attention and cleanliness allows icky bug stuff to get into our food. Not only is bug stuff gross, the legend says, but it can make you physically ill — and we're not just talking nausea. Logistically, though, this one falls down flat on its face. Even if the medical details were correct (and they're woefully wrong), how would the teller know that the roach had come from a Taco Bell taco? Had the poor girl eaten nothing else for the previous several days? There's no mention of her saving the remnants of her meal, much less of anyone's examining them. Even if the victim had retained some taco scraps, since she allegedly ate the roach along with the taco, what evidence would be left behind to discover? How did the eggs manage to get out of this \"pregnant roach\" and into the girl's salivary glands? Expectant roaches carry their eggs in a largish brown sac called an ootheca, a firm-walled egg case attached to Mama Roach's posterior. A roach ootheca is about the size of dried bean, not something that could be worked into anyone's gum line. Did mama fortuitously lay her eggs a split second before the grinding of a hungry girl's teeth shuffled Mrs. Roach off this mortal coil? If not, how did mama's eggs amazingly survive the crush of masticating molars that did her in? And how could the eggs enter the salivary glands, from which saliva (of course) is generally flowing out? Our horrific little story also stars a doctor who prescribes a topical cream for a swollen jaw supposedly caused by an \"allergic reaction,\" and who \"removes a couple of layers of inner mouth\" to get at an obstruction in the salivary glands. Maybe we're wrong to classify this one as a contaminated food or insect infestation legend — it sounds more like a scary indictment of our medical system. A similar \"cockroach eggs\" scare that began circulating in 2000 involved envelopes rather than tacos as the means of transmission:  This lady was working in a post office in California, one day she licked the envelopes and postage stamps instead of using a sponge. That very day the lady cut her tongue on the envelope. A week later, she noticed an abnormal swelling of her tongue. She went to the doctor, and they found nothing wrong. Her tongue was not sore or anything. A couple of days later, her tongue started to swell more, and it began to get really sore, so sore, that she could not eat. She went back to the hospital, and demanded something be done. The doctor, took an x-ray of her tongue, and noticed a lump. He prepared her for minor surgery. When the doctor cut her tongue open, a live roach crawled out. There were roach eggs on the seal of the envelope. The egg was able to hatch inside of her tongue, because of her saliva. It was warm and moist ... This is a true story ... Pass it on
 Everything said about cockroach eggs earlier still applies. This incarnation of the tale was every bit as much a hoax as the taco one. Variations: In May 2000 someone thought to add additional snippets of implied credibility to the \"envelope licking\" version quoted above:  Andy Hume wrote: Hey, I used to work in an envelope factory. You wouldn't believe the things that float around in those gum applicator trays. I haven't licked an envelope for years. This is a true story ... Pass it on
 This story was not reported on CNN. Pasting such authoritative-sounding taglines into the text of hoaxes circulating on the Internet in an effort to give them credibility is commonplace, and this was just another case of some nameless prankster doing just that.
Second, no one knows who \"Andy Hume\" is, so why give his supposed comments about working in an envelope factory any credence? It ain't all that tough to make up a comment and a name to go with it. If \"Andy Hume\" works for CNN, it's news to them. Searches of news databases for any reporter of that name turn up one who writes for <I>The Ottawa Citizen</I>, and wider searches turn up a British sports figure who also carries that name. There was also a Washington reporter, <U>Sandy</U> Hume, who killed himself in February 1998. But there's also no reason to assume any of those folks penned the comment circulated to bolster the credibility of the \"envelope\" <NOBR>e-mail.</NOBR> Last updated: 22 January 2014

"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/challenger-crew-tape/" "false" "Reports of a secret tape recorded aboard the doomed space shuttle Challenger that captured the final panic-stricken moments of the crew raised suspicions of a cover-up." "Brooke Binkowski" 2001-02-22 "A secret tape recorded aboard the doomed space shuttle Challenger captured the final panic-stricken moments of the crew." "Seventy-three seconds into the 28 January 1986 flight of the space shuttle Challenger the craft broke apart, killing the seven astronauts aboard. Videotapes released by NASA afterwards showed that a few seconds before the disaster, an unusual plume of fire and smoke could be seen spewing from the lower section of the shuttle's right solid-fuel rocket. It was generally assumed (and NASA did little to disturb this opinion) that all aboard died the moment the external tank blew up. NASA later conceded it was likely that at least three of the crew members aboard remained conscious after the explosion, and perhaps even throughout the few minutes it took forthe crew compartment of the shuttle to fall back to Earth and slam into the Atlantic Ocean. The agency was highly secretive about matters relating to the Challenger tragedy, actively fighting in the courts media requests to be allowed access to photographs of the wreckage, the details of the settlements made with the crews' families, or the autopsy reports, and this reticence to share information likely convinced some that there was more to the story than was being told. Such an environment breeds its own rumors, and Miami Herald reporter Dennis E. Powell wrote that the crew were likely all alive and conscious until the shuttle's crew compartment plunged into the Atlantic Ocean: When the shuttle broke apart, the crew compartment did not lose pressure, at least not at once. There was an uncomfortable jolt — \"A pretty good kick in the pants\" is the way one investigator describes it — but it was not so severe as to cause injury. This probably accounted for the \"uh oh\" that was the last word heard on the flight deck tape recorder that would be recovered from the ocean floor two months later. As they were feeling the jolt, the four astronauts on the flight deck saw a bright flash and a cloud of steam. The lights went out. The intercom went dead. After a few breaths, the seven astronauts stopped getting oxygen into their helmets. Someone, apparently astronaut Ronald McNair, leaned forward and turned on the personal emergency air pack of shuttle pilot Michael Smith. The PEAP of Commander Francis Scobee was in a place where it was difficult to reach. It was not activated. Even so, if the crew compartment did not rapidly lose air pressure, Scobee would only have had to lift his mask to be able to breathe. Two other PEAPs were turned on. The three others were never found. Though the shuttle had broken to pieces, the crew compartment was intact. It stabilized in a nose-down attitude within 10 to 20 seconds, say the investigators. Even if the compartment was gradually losing pressure, those on the flight deck would certainly have remained conscious long enough to catch a glimpse of the green-brown Atlantic rushing toward them. If it lost its pressurization very slowly or remained intact until it hit the water, they were conscious and cognizant all the way down. In fact, no clear evidence was ever found that the crew cabin depressurized at all. There was certainly no sudden, catastrophic loss of air of the type that would have knocked the astronauts out within seconds. Such an event would have caused the mid-deck floor to buckle upward; that simply didn't happen. A purported transcript of the Challenger crew's final horrifying moments has circulated online for many years, supposedly taken from a \"secret tape\" leaked from NASA: A secret NASA tape reveals that the crew of the shuttle Challenger not only survived the explosion that ripped the vessel apart; they screamed, cried, cursed and prayed for three hellish minutes before they slammed into the Atlantic and perished on January 28, 1986. The tape is said to begin with a startled crewman screaming,\"What happened? What happened? Oh God - No!\" Screams and curses are heard - several crewmen begin to weep - and then others bid their families farewell. Two minutes forty-five seconds later the tape ends. That's when the shuttles crew compartment, which remained intact after the vessel exploded over the Atlantic, hit the ocean at over 2,000 miles per hour, instantly killing the crew. \"Cover up? Of course there was a coverup,\" declared Robert Hotz, a member of the Presidential commission that investigated the disaster. \"NASA can't face the fact that they put these astronauts in a situation where they didn't have adequate equipment to survive. NASA doesn't give a damn about anything but covering it's ass,\" he said. The official account released by NASA ends with shuttle pilot Michael Smith saying, \"Uh-oh!\" Some NASA employees have evidently heard more - much more. And they provided the rest of the account based on what they've discussed within NASA in the last five years. The astronauts had time and realized something was happening after the shuttle broke up. \"All shuttle astronauts carry personal recorders and the tape in question apparently came from Christa's (McAuliffe), which was recovered after the shuttle disaster,\" said Hotz. Jarvis was sitting beside her, and when he figured out what was happening he said, \"Give me your hand.\" \"NASA insists there's nothing like that on tape but they're talking about the mission tape, not Christa's. So they're not lying, but they're not telling the truth, either.\" A journalist with close ties to NASA was even more emphatic, \"There are persistent rumors, dating back to the disaster, that this tape is absolutely bone-chilling.\" The following transcript begins two seconds after NASA's official version ends, with pilot Michael Smith saying, \"Uh-oh!\" Times from the moment of takeoff are shown in minutes and seconds and are approximate.

He maketh me to lie down in green pastures... though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil... I will dwell in the house... T+3:15 to end. None. Static, silence. Rest in Peace However, this \"transcript\" originated with an article published in a February 1991 issue of Weekly World News, a tabloid famous for creating news stories out of whole cloth. There never was such a transcript, nor was the crew of the Challenger known to have been wearing personal recorders. Moreover, personal recorders would not have picked up the comments of crew members on different decks as the faked transcript would have us believe. Not everyone aboard died the exact second the external tank exploded; that much is known. A complete understanding of exactly what happened in that cabin after the explosion remains elusive because the impact of the crash, plus the six weeks the wreckage and bodies spent in the sea, made it impossible to determine precisely when and how everybody aboard died. (Six weeks in sea water would also have ruined any unshielded audio tapes that miraculously survived the explosion and the crash.)  If the cabin depressurized immediately, the crew would have lived about 6 to 15 seconds after the blast; if not, they might have survived for the full two minutes and forty-five seconds it took the cabin to fall 65,000 feet back to Earth. They most certainly could not have lived through the crushing 207 mph impact with the waters off the Florida coast, which negates the wilder versions of \"survived astronauts\" rumors that had them still alive for hours (and even days) under the sea, waiting for rescuers who could not reach them in time. Possibly the best clue towards solving the mystery of how long the doomed crew survived lies in what NASA learned from examining the four emergency air packs recovered from the wreckage. Three had been manually activated, which demonstrated that at least some of the crew realized something had gone wrong and had taken steps to save themselves. However, the fourth unactivated pack speaks with an even stronger voice, indicating that most likely realization of the circumstances and loss of consciousness were occurring at roughly the same time. That was the conclusion of Dr. Joseph Kerwin, director of Life Sciences at the Johnson Space Center in Houston. His July 1986 report was based on an official examination of the debris of the crew compartment, audio tapes and other data recorded on the shuttle, the remains of the astronauts, and photographs of the capsule as it fell after the shuttle exploded. In the report, Dr. Kerwin said: \"The cause of death of the Challenger astronauts cannot be positively determined, the forces to which the crew were exposed during the orbiter breakup were probably not sufficient to cause death or serious injury, and the crew possibly, but not certainly, lost consciousness in the seconds following orbiter breakup due to in-flight loss of crew module pressure.\" In other words, they might well have lived for the full spiral down and might even have been fully conscious for all of that hellish descent. But even if so, this fabricated \"transcript\" does not preserve their final words." 2001 "Feb" 2 1980

"David Mikkelson" 2001-02-21 "Man high on drugs slices off pieces of his face and feeds them to his dogs." "Claim: Man high on drugs slices off pieces of his face and feeds them to his dogs. Status: Undetermined. Origins: One of the creepier scenes in Thomas Harris' 1999 novel Hannibal involves a character named Mason Verger. After the sinister Hannibal Lecter slips Verger some amyl nitrate (or \"poppers\"), he convinces Verger to scrape off pieces of his own face and feed them to his pet dog. Is this scene not only creepy, but based on a real-life incident as well? A photograph found in Practical Homicide Investigation, a book by former New York homicide detective Vernon J. Geberth, purportedly depicts a man who, while high on PCP, sliced off pieces of his face with a broken mirror and fed them to his dogs. (We don't reproduce this picture on this page because it might be a bit too much for the squeamish, but if you have the stomach for it, you can view it
here.) The caption reads: While under the influence of Angel Dust this man decided to peel off his own face using pieces of a broken mirror and feed the strips of flesh to his pet dogs. He survived due to the large amounts of drugs anesthetizing his system. The dogs were removed by police to the animal shelter, where their stomachs were pumped, resulting in the recovery of pieces of the man´s face, lips, and nose. This case, whose details were supposedly contained in \"closed medical records\" published only in Geberth's book, involved a black male in his late twenties who — while under the influence of PCP — used a broken mirror to slice up his entire face, dig out an eye (and render the other eye useless by severing the optic nerve), and cut off his ears, nose, and lips, all the while feeding pieces of his own flesh to his two dogs. The PCP provided enough of an anesthetizing effect that he reportedly survived the ordeal, although the drugs \"destroyed his brain function,\" left him \"a ward of the state,\" and created \"a plastic surgeon's nightmare\" for the hospital authorities who had to undertake the task of performing reconstructive surgery on him. We're not going to claim that the photograph and its explanation are all phony, but some of the details sound a bit odd to us. How did police know the man \"decided to feed the strips of flesh to his pet dogs\"? — he certainly wasn't in any condition to disclose what had happened. And why pump the stomachs of dogs who were not in any imminent danger? Were surgeons going to re-attach partially digested bits of the man's face (after rushing them over from the animal shelter)? Why even bother performing any type of reconstructive surgery on a man who had allegedly irreparably destroyed both his sight and his brain function? Why is this case part of a \"closed medical record,\" and if it was indeed \"closed,\" then how did it come to be published in a book? A 1989 book by Joseph Sacco, M.D., apparently picks up this story at the hospital: One of the most famous intravenous drugs for generating stories about bizarre behavior was phencyclidine: \"angel dust,\" or \"PCP.\" Although little is heard anymore about angel dust, it was well known for its ability to both addle and confer superhuman powers upon its abusers, or so the stories went. Tales of \"some guy who was dusted\" going berserk and beating up six cops before fifteen more managed to subdue him abounded. In my work in the [New York General Hospital], I witnessed some exceedingly strange dust-induced behavior, including one patient who'd done the most bizarre thing to himself I'd ever seen or heard of in my life. This man smoked dust one day and surprised his friends by politely excusing himself to the bathroom, bringing along his two Doberman pinschers. In the bathroom he opened the medicine cabinet, removed a straightedge razor, cut off his own facial features one by one, and fed them to his dogs. He emerged from the bathroom with no ears, nose, eyelids, lips, or cheeks, and two happy-looking dogs. His friends, now fairly distraught, brought him to the NYG emergency room, where the plastic and head and neck surgeons pissed in their pants with excitement. They took him straight to the operating room. Jokes emerged immediately. The man lost face, the surgeons tried to save face, etc., etc. In order to create a new face for this unfortunate patient, the surgeons did a \"pectoral flap,\" a fascinating procedure in which the pectoral (chest) muscle is removed and reimplanted at another site on a patient's body. The surgeon's don't remove the muscle completely, but leave intact is main artery and vein. The muscle is then \"flapped\" to the spot where it's needed, presumably a hole that is too deep to be filled by mere skin grafting, and sewn in place. Eventually, it grows a new blood supply at the transplant site and the surgeons remove the original artery and vein. The man with no face had two pectoral flaps done, one from each side of his chest to each side of his face. Once the muscles were well established in their new locations the surgeons took him back to the OR about two hundred times to cut and shape and revise the graft to create a new face for him. I know the story of the man with no face is true because I saw him walking down the hall a few weeks after he was admitted. He was wearing a surgical hood turned back in front, with two holes cut out for his eyes, like the \"elephant man.\" I whispered to a co-resident, \"Who's that?\" He looked at me with wide eyes. \"That's the man with no face!\" It was the most bizarre story I'd ever heard.

 Some of the details differ between the two versions (e.g., the victim using broken pieces of mirror vs. a straightedge razor), and it sounds as if both of the people quoted may not have been directly involved in the case but were instead reporting second-hand information. Given this and some other incongruities of the story, we're not quite ready to put it in the \"True\" column yet. Last updated: 28 January 2007

"Barbara Mikkelson" 2001-02-11 "A 1993 instance of product tampering resulted in syringes being found in cans of Pepsi." "Claim: A 1993 instance of product tampering resulted in syringes being found in cans of Pepsi. FALSE Origins: In 1990, a clerk for a Steinberg grocery store in eastern Ontario discovered something in a Pepsi bottle he at first mistook for a straw. A closer examination revealed the item to be a syringe, and the bottle was rescued from the shelf before it fell into the  hands of a consumer. The find was turned over to store management, who in turn brought it to the attention of Health and Welfare Canada. Health and Welfare Canada launched an investigation into the incident, and although they ultimately achieved no official resolution of the case, they reasoned the likely culprit was a disgruntled employee of the bottler, EastCan Beverages of Ottawa, Ontario. The incident was not repeated; no more syringes turned up in any other bottles. In an eerie way, that 1990 find was the precursor to the 1993 Pepsi syringe panic. Once again, hypodermic needles and this particular brand of cola met up, but this time the confluence of the two was pyrotechnic. In the space of two days in June 1993, news stories about finds of syringe-laden cans of Pepsi swept the USA. For a short time it looked like a widespread instance of product tampering was underway. The first report came on 9 June 1993 from an 82-year-old man in Tacoma, Washington, who said he looked into a can of Diet Pepsi to see if he had won a prize and found a syringe. (He had not noticed the hypodermic when he poured himself a drink from the can; he found the needle the next day.) Soon afterwards, similar reports flooded in from all over the USA. At least 52 reports of tampering in at least 23 states were ultimately made before this scare ran its course. Though most of the \"finds\" involved syringes (a woman in Portland, Oregon, said she found two in a single glass), the list of items allegedly recovered from Pepsi, Diet Pepsi, and Caffeine Free Diet Pepsi cans included a wood screw, a bullet, a crack vial, a broken sewing needle, and a mysterious blob of brown goo. Pepsi and the Food and Drug Administration soon ruled out product tampering as the cause of these \"finds.\" It quickly became obvious the beverager was the victim of a spontaneous hoax. Once the first find was publicized, a number of unscrupulous people who sought to cash in on it created a rolling wave of growing hysteria, as each news story prompted another phony \"find\" which in turn prompted another news story. Those looking for a quick buck reasoned it would be terribly easy to coax a little money out of Pepsi by claiming to have found needles in their drinks. This was a con that didn't take much to set up; all one needed was an opened can of Pepsi and a syringe. With so many real finds turning up, the company would be quick to pay off anyone who stood in line — or so the con artists thought. What they failed to realize was that all the finds (with the exception of the first) were bogus, and so they were all trying to pull the same scam as everyone else. (No plausible explanation for that first find ever came to light. The needle discovered by the elderly Tacoma couple was bent in the manner responsible insulin users are taught to leave a used syringe, and discarding such an implement in a soda can is a disposal method favored by many who have to regularly give themselves injections. Yet the only diabetic of the couple's acquaintance hadn't been in their home in eleven years. There was a further puzzling fact: the syringe supposedly turned up in a can of Diet Pepsi which came from a 24-can case of regular Pepsi.) Once Pepsi and the FDA was sure they knew what was going on, Pepsi launched an all-out campaign to reassure alarmed customers who dreaded getting stuck by needles secreted in their drinks. Officials at bottling plants threw open their doors to the press, demonstrating how it was virtually impossible to place an object in a can, and pointing out that even if that were accomplished, the tampered can would be easy to detect. (In 1993 Pepsi was producing 2,000 cans a minute at 150 plants on high-speed canning lines in which cans were inverted, shot with a blast of air or water, and then turned right side up and filled. Since the cans were open for only nine-tenths of a second, someone would have had to be awful quick to get a syringe into any of them.) The company took out ads in twelve national newspapers, and bottlers ran notices in 300 to 400 local dailies telling readers that the stories about Pepsi were a hoax. The FDA spokespeople spread the same message on Pepsi's behalf. Ultimately, the Federal Bureau of Investigation made twenty bunko arrests of people who had planted syringes or other objects in their drinks, and many other would-be claimants who had less seriously dabbled with making false claims against Pepsi recanted their stories. Some complainants were obviously pranksters, while others seemed to be trying to cash in on spurious injury claims. A few seemed only to want the attention of the news media — a paltry kind of fame, but apparently sufficient for some to want to seek it. Media coverage, denials, arrests — Pepsi fought the rumors of product tampering as actively and publicly as it was possible to fight them. Yet was it enough? Needle-find hysteria in 1993 was nothing compared to what it would be now, when every found hypodermic is presumed to be laden with the AIDS virus, but even so Pepsi will long be remembered as the soft drink with a syringe. The bell of rumor could not be unrung, even had the media cooperated. Unfortunately, the media didn't cooperate. As Gail de Vos points out in her 1996 Tales, Rumors, and Gossip, accounts of obvious post-purchase can tampering never came close to achieving the same level of prominence in the press as accounts of the original horrifying find did. As an example, she cites coverage by The Edmonton Journal, which was typical of how many news outlets handled resolution of this news story: \"The first two articles appeared in the front section of the paper but the final outcome was not considered of equal importance — hence its appearance in the E section!\" While the slogan \"If it bleeds, it leads\" holds just as true here as with any other news topic, one might just as rightly coin \"once it's nary'd, it gets buried.\" Tidy, fact-filled resolution articles that explain away previous misreporting just aren't nearly as interesting to the public as headlines which scream \"Beware of this lurking danger: it could happen to you!\" The press know that, so articles of such ilk get tossed deep into the paper where most folks won't encounter them. This escalates the problem of an increasingly hysterical public: uneven coverage leads folks to believe their world is fraught with lurking dangers. Why should they not believe just that when the front page is filled day after day with one horrific story after another, yet the calm, rational stuff is habitually buried in the E section? The \"syringe in the Pepsi can\" tale is a fine case in point of the results of this form of weighted reporting.
Although most folks who were media-aware in 1993 remember news stories about needles found in soft drink cans, not all that many of them could now (or even back then) tell you the whole thing turned out to be a hoax, an attempt on the part of a number of miscreants to rifle the deep pockets of a large corporation. To the majority, the story will always remain \"bad guys hid needles in Pepsi cans, and I could have gotten hurt,\" not \"scam artists tried to shake down Pepsi by pretending to find tampered cans.\" Barbara \"all that's now remembered is the fizz\" Mikkelson Last updated: 26 May 2011

"Barbara Mikkelson" 2001-02-07 "A child died from drinking the contents of a prize-bearing Coca-Cola 'MagiCan.'" "Claim: A child died from drinking the contents of a prize-bearing Coca-Cola 'MagiCan.' Status: False. Example: [Collected on the Internet, 2000]  Origins: In 1990 Coca-Cola was once again  locked into combat with Pepsi in another skirmish of the war for market share. The lucrative youth market was the chosen battlefield, and both companies were actively contesting it via similar giveaway promotions involving prize-laden cans. Pepsi's entry in this field was a promotion featuring \"Cool Cans,\" soda cans that had prizes printed on the inside bottom. Coke chose to tie its freebies to technology, coming up with special \"MagiCans\" that dispensed cash and gift certificates. Winning cans were fashioned with spring-loaded devices that were supposed to lift rolled pieces of currency (from $1 to $500) or coupons redeemable for trips or merchandise out of their openings when their tabs were pulled. To prevent consumers from identifying partially-filled Coke cans as winners by discerning differences in weight or listening for sloshing sounds, Coca-Cola added a chamber of chlorinated water to these special cans. This special water was doctored with the addition of ammonium sulfate, a foul-smelling yet harmless substance placed there to prevent anyone from mistaking the chlorinated water for Coca-Cola. It also served to alert the lucky consumers that they were holding winning cans, not just misfilled ones, if they somehow failed to notice their prizes and managed to gain access to the sealed-off liquid in the cans' bottoms. In theory these things worked great. In practice, the MagiCans had their problems. Several of the mechanisms which pushed rolled-up money out of cans turned out to be defective. The problem proved widespread, prompting Coca-Cola to run ads in fifty major newspapers in May 1990 asking consumers to \"Take A Good Look\" at cans they'd opened, and acknowledging that in \"a small number of instances, the prize mechanism may jam.\" The ads included lists of \"dos and don'ts\" for consumers and provided a toll-free number winners could use to find out how to claim prizes that defective cans failed to eject. Coca-Cola also purchased television time for the delivery of the same message. The problems didn't end there. Some of the prize cans sprang leaks in the special compartments that held the noxious-smelling liquid used as ballast. In some cases, this caused genuine confusion about just what the heck was in those cans. In May 1990, 11-year-old Zachary Gendron of North Andover drank from one of the defective cans. His parents took a whiff of the clear, bad-smelling liquid and felt a foreign object inside the can. \"Knowing nothing about the promotion, we thought it might be a case of product tampering,\" said Robin Gendron, Zachary's mother. The Gendrons handed the can over to the local police, who dissected the can back at the station and contacted state health officials. Young Zachary had gotten a winning can that misfired. His prize, a soggy five-dollar bill, was duly retrieved and presented to him (although his mother threatened to have it framed), and Coca-Cola also sent along coupons good for free product. Despite the confusion over his find, the boy had never been in any danger — the potential harm from drinking the doctored water was limited to possible nausea. Stories about marketing misfires are often \"improved\" by making them out to be even greater disasters than they were. That a child had ingested a substance not meant to be drunk was enough to start a rumor that a Coca-Cola promotion gone wrong had killed a kid, thereby recasting \"Coke Adds Life\" as \"Coke Takes Life.\" Barbara \"drank himself to death, he did\" Mikkelson Last updated: 30 July 2006

"Barbara Mikkelson" 2001-02-06 "Motorcyclist is decapitated by a sheet of metal which falls from a passing truck." "We know this story has been around at least since the late 1970s. As for whether it's true or not, news reports about motorcyclists decapitated by things sliding off trucks yet who continue to ride on have yet to surface. As printed in Rodney Dale's The \"Tumour in the Whale\" A motorcyclist was riding behind a lorry which was carrying a load of thin steel plates. He decided to overtake the lorry, but as he moved out towards the centre of the road, one of the steel sheets became dislodged and decapitated him. However, his momentum carried him alongside the lorry, the lorry-driver glanced from his window, saw the headless motorcyclist passing, had a heart attack, ran off the road and was killed. The details of the story sometimes vary. In some versions, a sheet of corrugated or roofing iron, a pane of glass, or a thin steel plate fly from the truck. Sometimes the carnage doesn't end with the truck driver's death — his out-of-control vehicle plows into a crowd beside the road or takes out a mother holding a baby. However, in a cruel instance of ostension, a motorist did indeed lose her life in such fashion. On 19 December at 8:45 a.m. while driving on the Gulf freeway in Houston, Linda Riojas (43) was hit by a flying piece of metal, presumed to have come off the back of a transport trailer. The 3 feet long by 20 inches wide and one-fourth of an inch thick object came through her windshield and decapitated her, then landed next to a Bible sitting on the back passenger seat. No one else was in the vehicle at the time. The appeal of the legend is universal — we like accounts of gruesome deaths because they serve to confirm that life is a fragile thing. The notion that at any moment the fabric of our safe, sensible world could be rent with a scene of unspeakable horror titillates us. We therefore remind ourselves that no matter how ordinary the corner we're standing on or how mundane the day that took us there, at any moment a headless motorcycle rider could come shooting by. Horror legends are rife with beheadings because this form of demise is especially gruesome. Not only does a freakish accident result in loss of life, it leaves behind a mutilated corpse lacking a head. In a flash, the mind is cut off from the body, ending a life. A person who moments before was a living, thinking being is now just a headless trunk, spurting blood. Though all forms of demise lead to the same place, this one is sickly fascinating thanks to its elevated gore quotient and the speed with which it drives home the finality of death. Our society is not the first to be enthralled with the specters of decapitated riders, as many a headless horseman gallops across the pages of ghost lore and hero tales. In updatings of these older legends, ghostly headless motorcyclists are said to frequent certain old roads, such as the headless haunt who reportedly appears on Old Creek Road in Ojai, California, to ride alongside drivers on his vintage 1940s motorcycle. Ohio has its headless motorcyclist of Elmore, whom legend says repeats his fatal ride time and again." 2001 "Feb" 2 NA

"Barbara Mikkelson" 2001-02-05 "A photo opportunity involving a bear and a honey-smeared child resulted in a terrible mauling." "[Collected on the Internet, 1994] I heard this one in a Nat'l Public Radio report a long time ago. The report was about National Parks and some of the problems they have. Many of the problems, according to this article, are because people don't know how to act in the wilderness. So this park ranger was telling the reporter about bad things that have happened to people in the national parks. According to this ranger, people try to get their pictures taken with bears. He told how one parent smeared honey all over his child's head so the bear would play with him & make a cute picture. The ranger was just about in tears as he told how the child got mauled. In the canonical version of this ursine parental horrors tale, parents intent upon getting a picture of the cute bear kissing the baby smear honey on the child's face. The bear tears into the child, ripping its face to pieces. Did this ever happen? We've yet to find any news story documenting such an attack. On the other hand, the papers contain many accounts of fatal bear maulings and close calls involving both adults and children. Though the honey-smeared child tale may well be nothing more than legend, its cautions against taking bears lightly are well-founded. People are stunningly unaware of how dangerous bears can be and mistake the creatures' seemingly slow movements for signs of docility. Deep in my photo box is a photograph of a black bear at Canada's Algonquin Park. This photo (along with others now lost) was snapped by my parents in 1969 as the three of us (and numerous others) observed the bears as they came to browse the park's garbage dump at twilight. Though we maintained what we felt was a safe distance, in truth we were placing our trust in the bears' preoccupation with their garbagy finds. Had that preoccupation dissipated even for a moment, or had a camper gotten close enough to the bears to be perceived as a threat, those photographs could well have recorded a far different scene. Though bear attacks are relatively rare, they can be fatal. Bears have pulled people out of tents and eaten them. These are not creatures to be mistaken for something cute and harmless. [Miniclier, 1994] If you suddenly find yourself face to face with a black bear don't approach it, don't try to feed it, and don't try to get your photo taken with it. Instead, back away slowly, while talking soothingly to it, advise bear experts across the Rockies. In the extremely unlikely event that a black bear, or mountain lion, actually attacks you \"the best thing to do is fight as hard as you can with stones or sticks and yell and scream and try to drive him away,\" says [Todd] Malmsbury [of the Colorado Division of Wildlife]. \"If you are passive and play dead he may convert you to food,\" warns Dr. Steve French, a surgeon who has operated on many bear victims. French, who tours the country giving bear safety lectures, is in his 12th year of grizzly bear research at Yellowstone National Park. Although the attack described might never have happened, at least one photograph of a bear licking a honey-smeared child exists; indeed, it's possible memories of that photo sparked the legend. A two-month-old bear cub was found during a forest fire in May 1950 in New Mexico. The game warden flew the cub to Santa Fe, where a vet nursed him; a photographer, dabbing honey on the chin of the warden's daughter, got a picture that captured America's heart: the cub licking her face. The bear went on to take up residence in Washington's National Zoo." 2001 "Feb" 2 1950

"Barbara Mikkelson" 2001-01-29 "Hours after sending her boyfriend in search of gasoline, a girl is rescued from her stranded car by police. Though cautioned not to turn around, she does...and sees her boyfriend's lifeless body hanging from a tree branch above the car." "The earliest documented instance of this story was collected in 1964 from a freshman at the University of Kansas. Since that time the story has spread mightily, and it's now uncommon to encounter anyone who hasn't heard it. As for how widespread it is, by the late 1970s, a version was circulating in Malaysia. Examples: [Collected on the Internet, 1994] Two students had gone out to neck in a car on an isolated country road. Afterwards, the car wouldn't start. The girlfriend got spooked. The boyfriend said he would walk for help, but suggested she first get down on the floor of the car in the back and put a blanket over her so no one looking in would see her... and told her not to look out or get out until he returned and told her to, no matter what she heard. Then he walked off, leaving her hidden. He didn't return, and he didn't return, and then she heard a strange tap-tap-tap sound on top of the car. Tap-tap-tap. Despite her growing panic, she didn't get out and remained huddled there, all night long, listening to the irregular tapping sounds. Finally, the day grew light outside and she heard someone walking up to the car. A man's voice called out \"Is anyone in there?\" It was the local sheriff. She peeked out and he told her to get out of the car, walk down the road to the waiting sheriff's car, and whatever she did, not to look back at the car. She walked down the road to the sheriff's car but looked back at the last minute and saw her boyfriend's head impaled on the CB antenna, dripping blood onto the car. [Collected on the Internet, 1998] A teenager is driving his girlfriend home from a date. The boy had been playing around earlier about the car running out of gas as a means to make out with her. Well, it doesn't work and she's mad. He starts up the car to take her home, apologizing all the way, when lo and behold they actually do run out of gas. He pulls the car over by some trees. It's very late and the area is secluded and wooded. The boy tells his girlfriend that he saw a gas station a couple of miles back and since going ahead would take even longer, he tells her to stay in the car with the windows rolled up and locked and he'll get back as fast as he can, no sense in both of them going, right? Well, the girl waits in the car. It's been about 20 minutes when she hears a faint scratching noise. It starts to bother her, but she blows it off as the tree branches hitting the car, it had been windy that day, She decides to turn on the radio to listen to some music so it won't freak her out. Well, now it's been almost 2 hours and she's starting to get worried. Her boyfriend was a jock and could have easily made it there and back in under an hour. A half hour later she's very worried and decides to turn off the radio and look around. He had told her not to get out under any circumstances so she tries to peer out the window, she sees nothing. To her annoyment the scratching sound is still there. She decides that she will get out just long enough to break off that damn branch. She gets out and notices the gas can on the ground near the door. She immediately turns around and sees her boyfriend hanging upside down from the tree, throat slit, and his fingernails dragging across the top of the car making a scratching sound. Of course, had she been listening to talk radio instead of music, she would have known a maniac had escaped from the asylum near the woods where they were parked.
 [Healey & Glanvill, 1996] A lass someone at college knew was travelling in her boyfriend's car late at night through the New Forest when their car suddenly started spluttering and stalled. They'd run out of petrol in the middle of nowhere. At first she thought it might be a ruse by her bloke to get a bit of rural slap and tickle, but the concern on his face soon scotched that. It was pitch black, and the only light they could see was coming from what looked like a mansion or hospital some miles away. The boyfriend told her to lock the doors and wait while he went for help. Hours passed, and still no sign of him. She was beginning to get very nervous. Still more time went by, when she was startled by a horrendous banging on the back, then the top of the car. Before she could scream, the car was surrounded by police cars with lights flashing and sirens wailing. A voice over a loud-hailer told her: \"Get out of the car slowly, walk steadily towards the police line, and don't, repeat don't, look around.\" She did as she was told, but as she neared the police line, she couldn't stop herself looking round at the car to see what was making the awful thumping noise . . . only to see an escaped psychopath banging her boyfriend's severed head on the car roof. Variations: <IMG ALT=\"Cartoon of urban legend\" HSPACE=16 VSPACE=16 WIDTH=204 HEIGHT=275 SRC=\"https://www.snopes.com/uploads/images/horrors/graphics/boyfrend.jpg\" ALIGN=RIGHT BORDER=1> It's possible the roots of legends like The Boyfriend's Death and The Hook lie in distorted memories of real life Lover's Lane murders. There were actual cases of kids who went out necking and came back in pine boxes. The residue of news stories about those events would likely remain around for a while, mutating into cautionary tales with the addition of bloody hooks and scraping sounds on the roof of the car. Common elements of The Boyfriend's Death include the parked couple, the abandoned girl, the mysterious scratching, tapping or dripping, the daybreak rescue by parents or police, the entreaty not to look back, and the hanging or decapitated boyfriend. Wherever and however this story is told, the injunction not to look back is a constant. Taboos like this are always broken in folklore, whether in fairy tales or in modern urban legends. When she disobeys and looks, the girl's hair turns white from shock — another familiar legend motif and itself a reminder of what happened to Lot's wife when she ignored a similar instruction. The girl in this story is perceived as helpless and incapable of venturing away from the safety of the car (no one ever suggests she accompany her boyfriend), whereas her male companion immediately dons the mantle of midnight adventurer and seeker of help. The stereotyped roles of frightened female and fearless male are strictly adhered to. His job is to do battle with the unknown whereas hers is to obey orders, staying with the car no matter what until rescued. Not even thumps, bumps, or scratching noises incite her to attempt to save herself. Interestingly, the heroine in the 1998 version quoted earlier on this page does disobey the boyfriend's orders. This lone exception in the 30-plus years of this legend's history leaves the vehicle without being instructed to do so. Even then, it's not to go looking for help or to find out what happened to her companion, it's to dispose of an annoying branch which is tapping on the car, disturbing the tranquility of her long wait to be rescued. Well, at least it's a start. Barbara \"sybil disobedience\" Mikkelson Sightings:

"Barbara Mikkelson" 2001-01-29 "A worker who stood too close to microwave radiation was cooked by its rays." "Example: [Collected on the Internet, 1999] (25 December 1998, Canada) Telephone relay company night watchman Edward Baker, 31, was killed early Christmas morning by excessive microwave radiation exposure. He was apparently attempting to keep warm next to a telecommunications feedhorn. Baker had been suspended on a safety violation once last year, according to Northern Manatoba Signal Relay spokesperson Tanya Cooke. She noted that Baker's earlier infraction was for defeating a safety shutoff switch and entering a restricted maintenance catwalk in order to stand in front of the microwave dish. He had told coworkers that it was the only way he could stay warm during his twelve-hour shift at the station, where winter temperatures often dip to forty below zero. Microwaves can heat water molecules within human tissue in the same way that they heat food in microwave ovens. For his Christmas shift, Baker reportedly brought a twelve pack of beer and a plastic lawn chair, which he positioned directly in line with the strongest microwave beam. Baker had not been told about a tenfold boost in microwave power planned that night to handle the anticipated increase in holiday long-distance calling traffic. Baker's body was discovered by the daytime watchman, John Burns, who was greeted by an odor he mistook for a Christmas roast he thought Baker must have prepared as a surprise. Burns also reported to NMSR company officials that Baker's unfinished beers had exploded. Origins: Those in the telecommunications industry have known the \"cooked telephone man\" legend for many a year now — it's a perennial tale among them. One of our correspondents recalls hearing it in 1985, soon after he joined British Columbia Telephone Co. Another was regaled with it in 1962 by his family, who claimed the accident had happened around 1950 in Montana when the DEW line was being installed. As he heard it: An unfortunate workman was installing a component and by some accident or other, the scanner was turned on. His body was found fully cooked. Other family members embellished by reporting that they had heard how the guy supposedly smelled delicious, causing many of the co-workers to either upchuck or become vegetarians. The tale given as the example at the top of this page is often circulated on the Internet as the winner of the 1999 or 1998 \"Darwin Award.\" In common with the majority of such offerings, it's a leg-pull — no such accident occurred. Clues to the fabricated nature of the story are contained in the names of the participants: the victim, \"Baker\"; his discoverer, \"Burns\"; and the spokesman, \"Cooke.\" That particular write-up was the work of Mark Boslough, a member of the group New Mexicans for Science and Reason, a local version of the Boulder-based Rocky Mountain Skeptics. He attached his microwaved worker offering to a then-current list of Darwin Award stories, declared his entry to be that year's winner, and mailed it out. A history of that hoax is available on the NMSR Darwin Award Wins! page, written by NMSR president Dave Thomas. The hoax included elements which were (or could have been) true, thereby giving it surface credibility. Some telecommunications microwave installations do employ wavelengths close to those used by microwave ovens, there are microwave towers in Thompson, and it does get cold in the winter in Manitoba. However, there is no such company as \"Northern Manitoba Signal Relay\" — that name was chosen as another (albeit subtle) clue to the falsity of the tale. NMSR, the initial letters of this name, are the same as those of New Mexicans for Science and Reason. In real life, there haven't been any suddenly-zapped workers, not even any slowly cooked-to-death ones. (Controversy over other dangers posed to humans by microwaves exists, though.) Although \"microwaved worker\" tales might have begun as an expression of fear related to a then-new technology, their ongoing popularity may well be due to a continuing controversy over whether electromagnetic radiation emitted from radio towers presents a danger to area inhabitants. On the one side, the powers that be state these microwaves are safe; on the other, some observers claim a correlation between the presence of radio towers and increases in the incidence of cancer. Those who are convinced that microwave emissions can be deadly often point to the 1974 demise of Samuel Yannon, a Staten Island telephone technician, as an example of the effects of cumulative long-term exposure to industrial microwaves. Yannon was plagued by a host of illnesses in his last years and finally succumbed to pneumonia, and his maladies were attributed to prolonged exposure to microwaves used in telecommunications during his years with New York Telephone, sixteen of which were spent in proximity to the television relay tower on the Empire State Building. The New York State Workmen's Compensation Board upheld his widow's claim for compensation on this basis in 1981. Whatever real-life basis might lie behind such stories, tales about fatal microwaving abound in popular lore: [Smith, 1983] In the kitchen of a large hotel a microwave oven had been installed. However, rather than being set at eye level, like the majority of such ovens, this one was fitted down low — almost at waist height in fact. One day a young pastry chef who worked at a table across the aisle from this cooker, was suddenly taken ill and in seconds collapsed and died. On investigation, it was discovered that every time he stepped back to admire his handiwork he stood with his back against the microwave oven door. Unfortunately, the oven door did not seal properly and over a period of time it had slowly cooked his kidneys and it was this that had eventually killed him. Other \"cooked to death\" legends include: Also Told in: Healey, Phil and Rick Glanvill. \"Now! That's What I Call Urban Myths.\"

"Barbara Mikkelson" 2001-01-15 "An inattentive janitor caused several deaths in a hospital when he disconnected patients' life support systems to plug in a floor polisher." "The 1990s saw the spread of a shocking account of tragic, accidental deaths in the very place where people are supposed to recover from their illnesses -- a hospital: [Collected on the Internet, 1996] \"For several months, our nurses have been baffled to find a dead patient in the same bed every Friday morning,\" a spokeswoman for the Pelonomi Hospital (Free State, South Africa) told reporters. \"There was no apparent cause for any of the deaths, and extensive checks on the air conditioning system, and a search for possible bacterial infection, failed to reveal any clues.\" \"However, further inquiries have now revealed the cause of these deaths. It seems that every Friday morning a cleaner would enter the ward, remove the plug that powered the patient's life support system, plug her floor polisher into the vacant socket, then go about her business. When she had finished her chores, she would plug the life support machine back in and leave, unaware that the patient was now dead. She could not, after all, hear the screams and eventual death rattle over the whirring of her polisher.\" \"We are sorry, and have sent a strong letter to the cleaner in question. Further, the Free State Health and Welfare Department is arranging for an electrician to fit an extra socket, so there should be no repetition of this incident. The enquiry is now closed.\"  [Collected on the Internet, 2003] There was a case in one hospital's Intensive Care ward where patients always died in the same bed, on Sunday morning at 11 A.M., regardless of their medical condition. This puzzled the doctors and some even thought that it had something to do with the supernatural. No one could solve the mystery as to why the deaths occurred around 11 A. M. on Sundays. So, a Worldwide team of experts was assembled to investigate the cause of the incidents. The next Sunday morning, a few minutes before 11 A. M., all the doctors and nurses nervously wait outside the ward to see for themselves what the terrible phenomenon was all about. Some were holding wooden crosses, prayer books and other holy objects to ward off the evil spirits. Just when the clock struck 11... Pookie Johnson, The part-time Sunday sweeper, entered the ward and unplugged the life support system so that he could use the vacuum cleaner. If nothing else, the bit about the hospital's sending a sharply-worded letter to the cleaning company who employee was responsible for multiple deaths should give one pause. Was ensuring that the janitor was reprimanded by his employer really the hospital's greatest concern? Oftentimes it's the tail ends of these stories which make the difference between cute ones which get told once or twice then drop out of sight, and ones such as this, which get forwarded all over the world. The floor cleaner's mistake is bad enough; what sends this story over the top is the callous matter-of-factness of the hospital. What does it say about health care in South Africa? Summer 1996 saw this hilarious yet chilling account take the Internet by storm. In an article purportedly from the 13 June 1996 Cape Times (\"Cleaner Polishes Off Patients\"), it quickly became the story of the moment. Various publications picked it up and ran it as a news item, adding to the legend's credibility. Bottom line: no matter how many papers you might have read that said different, there were no Friday massacres in Pelonomi Hospital, no murdering floor cleaners, no overly-callous hospital spokespeople imperiously intoning, \"The enquiry is now closed.\" It's folklore, pure and simple — a tall tale that got loose, then went on a rampage. How did this amazing story come to be taken as a news item? As always, through a misunderstanding. The legend had been around forever, so Die Volksblad (a small yet widely-circulated rural South African newspaper) took it upon itself to get to the bottom of this persistent rumor. Part of that effort to uncover the truth resulted in a Die Volksblad article asking those related to the victim(s) to come forward. That article was picked up by Die Burger, and it was Die Burger's article which Cape Times got its hands on. In much the same way children playing a game of \"Telephone\" will invariably garble the message, Cape Times' version came out as a news story, not as a rural paper's attempt to sort fact from fiction. From there the tale went to other publications, very few of whom bothered to check either with Pelonomi hospital or Die Volksblad. Those journalists who checked with Cape Times (and not all of them did even this much) were told that yes, it had run a story about this. Unknown both to the reporters doing the asking and Cape Times personnel doing the answering, the version made popular by the Internet and the actual Cape Times article weren't the same. The Internet version had been greatly embellished, further garbling the already hopelessly garbled and creating by the stroke of a few electrons a suitably cold-hearted but entirely fictional spokeswoman for Pelonomi Hospital. From there on in, it became a zoo, with publications such as New Scientist and the Sunday Telegraph claiming this as a news item. And why not indeed? Cape Times was telling them it was. South African folklorist Arthur Goldstuck was involved with this tale almost from the moment it appeared. His fascinating \"Cleaner Polishes Off Patient\" FAQ is filled with an incredible depth of detail about this legend. Although the \"murdering South African floor cleaner\" tale was new in 1996, its basic plot was as old as the hills, as demonstrated by this anecdote from a 1967 issue of Reader's Digest: British engineers feared that they would have to replan the Dungesness nuclear station in Kent, after studying a special model which showed the flow of rivers and estuaries in the area. Then they discovered the reason for the puzzling variations in the model's water level. An office cleaner had been filling her bucket from it each day. Once again, a dull-witted office cleaner is said to have upset Technology's applecart while discharging her janitorial duties. The charwoman does not recognize the \"special model\" serves a particular purpose — she views it merely as something she can fill her bucket from and uses it as such. Likewise, the South African floor cleaner perceives the loaded outlet in Intensive Care only as a place to plug in a needed piece of cleaning equipment — recognition that whatever is already occupying that outlet might be important eludes him. The theme of both these stories appears in another tale collected in 1993, this one poking fun not at office cleaners, but at office workers. Around noon every day the computer system at some office keeps freezing out. Five minutes later the system will power back up again. No one can figure out what's going on — software checks out, hardware checks out, everything is as protected as it can be from a power surge, and besides, why would there be a power surge every day around the same time? Finally, one bright whiz kid decides to keep an eye on the main server as the only thing that makes sense is someone has to be fooling with it. Sure enough, a little after noon one of the secretaries comes by with a kettle in hand, reaches down, unplugs the server ... An additional thread ties all of these stories together. It's no accident these legends are told about janitors and secretaries: they are considered lesser beings in the world of labor and are often presumed to be of lower intelligence. In each of these tales, someone from the bottom rungs of the corporate ladder who has access to key equipment but lacks so much as a basic understanding of its function and importance screws the pooch. Such tales confirm the commonly-held stereotypes of those who hold those jobs. Given how prevalent similar tales are, there was very little excuse for the journalistic outpouring the South African floor cleaner story provoked in 1996. (One need not hear a joke told the same way each time to recognize it as the same joke, after all.) This mess proved so very conclusively that even newspapermen fall victim to 'I read it in the paper, so it must be true.\" Sightings: This legend figures in an episode of the British police drama A Touch of Frost (\"Benefit of the Doubt,\" original air date 15 January 2001)." 2001 "Jan" 1 1960

"David Mikkelson" 2001-01-04 "A human finger was found in a can of menudo." "Claim: A human finger was found in a can of menudo. Status: False. Origins: Product adulteration tales are nothing new. From mice in bottles of Coca-Cola to batter-fried rats and chicken heads served by fast food restaurants, grisly tales of contaminated food have been common occurrences for many years now. Although food contamination is a reality, most of the lurid, widely publicized tales  about unusual objects found in food are the result of scams, hoaxes, sabotage, or flat-out mistakes. No matter how earnestly putative victims may insist there can be no disputing that they found something yucky in their food, all such claims should be taken with very large doses of salt until they have been confirmed by investigators (e.g., the much ballyhooed March 2005 case of a finger found in a bowl of Wendy's chili turned out to be an attempt to defraud that fast food chain). A case in point is the saga of Juanita's Farms, a California-based Mexican food firm who saw their sales plummet in 1987 as the result of a false report that circulated for only a few days before being demonstrated false. On January 2, 1987, brothers Freddie and Phillip Ureno and their wives sat down to dinner in their Southern California home. In this case the meal was nothing fancy, just some canned menudo (beef tripe stewed in a hominy base with chili powder) produced by a local company called Juanita's Foods. Even this simple dinner soon proved unsatisfactory when the hungry family discovered an unexpected — and decidedly unsavory — ingredient in their stew: a two-inch piece of human finger. There was no doubt it was a finger; it even had a fingernail still attached to it. The horrified recipients of this \"finger food\" followed what seemed like a reasonable course of action. They dumped the uneaten portion of their stew in the backyard. They washed off the foreign object and took it to a nearby hospital for analysis, where a pathologist identified it as a human finger. They reported their discovery to the police and handed it over to them. Others acted reasonably as well. The police delivered the Urenos' specimen to federal food inspectors. The supermarket where the Urenos had purchased the menudo pulled the product from their shelves. The local newspaper ran a short article about the discovery after confirming with the police that a hospital had verified it was indeed a finger. The news agency United Press International picked up the story after they spoke to a police lieutenant who confirmed both that he had seen the finger and that the hospital had examined it. A local television station ran a report about the Urenos' disturbing discovery. National radio commentator Paul Harvey reported that Juanitas Foods' menudo was \"being removed from grocery store shelves in Southern California since Freddie Ureno found part of a human finger in his.\" The most shocking part of the story was yet to come . . . not a bit of it was true. Juanita's Foods didn't see any way sliced a finger could have ended up in one of their cans of menudo, since no serious accident had taken place at their plant, and their workers wore wire mesh gloves that knives could not penetrate in order prevent just such an occurrence. They were right. Federal food inspectors from the United States Department of Agriculture found that the object wasn't a human finger at all, but a piece of connective tissue typically found in the tripe that is a main ingredient of menudo. Despite what Paul Harvey reported, only the one store where the Urenos made their purchase pulled cans of Juanita's Farms menudo off their shelves. And the hospital hadn't identified the object as a finger — a member of the emergency room staff had merely advised the Urenos to report their discovery to the police without offering an opinion about what it was. The UDSA's report came a few days too late; the damage was done. Over the next four months, Juanita's Farms sales were off $1 million from the same period the year before. So, when someone claims to have found a chicken head in her McDonald's fried chicken but won't hand it over to be examined, there's good reason to be skeptical. Very good reason indeed.

"Barbara Mikkelson" 2000-12-27 "Thinking she could fly, Diane Linkletter accidentally jumped to her death while high on LSD." "Claim: Thinking she could fly, Diane Linkletter accidentally jumped to her death while high on LSD. Status: False. Origins: On 4 October 1969, at 9 a.m. on a Saturday morning, a 20-year-old girl jumped from her kitchen window. She died in the hospital an hour and a half later from injuries sustained in that fall. Two  factors elevated this most ordinary of suicides to a news story that immediately caught the nation's interest and later formed a vital \"fact\" used to support a popular drug-related urban legend: the girl's identity and the widespread claim she'd been high on LSD at the time she went out the window. The girl was Diane Linkletter, the youngest of beloved television and radio personality and author Art Linkletter's five children. Due to the sense of identification the public had with her famous father, her death came to symbolize a tragedy that could be visited upon any home at any time. His on-air warmth and innocence made many feel they knew him, and thus his pain became their own. Diane's death helped spread a widespread urban legend that lives on to this day, although it was around well before her fatal plunge. According to a popular story that warns young people about the dangers of drug use, \"some girl\" jumps from a window while on an acid trip because the drug fools her into thinking she can fly. The claims immediately made after Diane's death that she had been on LSD, coupled with her method of suicide, seemed to some to fit this existing cautionary tale, and afterwards her demise was pointed to as an example of this legend's coming true. Yet it wasn't true, although members of her family attempted to blur the line between what had happened to Diane and her use of drugs as a possible cause for it. We can only speculate upon their reasons for doing so, but we should note that it is not all uncommon for those left behind after a suicide to work to convince others the death was one of misadventure and not the deliberate ending of a life. There is still a stigma attached to suicide, and families may view cloaking such matters in more socially acceptable terms as one final act of loyalty they can perform for the one who has gone before. (At one time the stigma was far greater and bore serious consequences that could impact upon the fate of the suicide's mortal soul. Those who had taken their lives could not be interred in hallowed ground. Families in days past tried to pass off all manner of self-inflicted deaths as accidental, lest their loved ones be refused burial in the churchyard and forfeit any remaining chance of resurrection.) Those who are left to grieve sometimes choose to reject evidence of deliberate suicide in favor of the more comforting fiction of accidental death. This act of self-deception serves to cocoon them from a pain too terrible to bear. The untimely death of a young person is always a tragedy, but most can eventually make their peace with it, ultimately chalking it up to a horrible caprice of fate. How much harder it is to attempt to deal with a child's death by suicide when confronted by questions such as: Was there something I was supposed to notice? Was there something I could have done? If I'd listened a bit harder, could I have prevented this? For some, the only answer is to refuse to acknowledge that there was a suicide, or to adopt a view of events that exaggerates the importance of outside factors upon the final outcome, thus lessening the suicide's responsibility for his actions. Better to live with \"He took drugs, and the drugs made him take his life\" than to face \"He was horribly unhappy, and there should have been something one of us could have done about this.\" Whatever the Linkletter family's motivations, what cannot be denied is they made numerous attempts to convince others that Diane's death was primarily due to drugs and not attributable to her own state of unhappiness. To better understand what part (if any) drugs played in this girl's death, we must examine the circumstances of Diane Linkletter's demise. (This is a difficult task thanks to the prominence the press gave the comments of the family: the family's pronouncements about what they asserted happened are weaved throughout the various news stories about Diane's death. Wheat and chaff were never so closely wed.) At 9 a.m. on the morning of 4 October 1969, Diane Linkletter lept from the kitchen window of her West Hollywood apartment (at the Shoreham Towers at 8785 Shoreham Drive), plunging six floors to the sidewalk below. She died at County USC Medical Center at 10:30 a.m. The preliminary cause of death was given as \"multiple traumatic injuries\" according to a coroner's statement. An autopsy was conducted that afternoon. Edward Durston (27) of 1211 Horn Avenue, West Hollywood, was in Diane's apartment at the time of the fall. He was never considered a suspect in her death. He arrived at 3 a.m., after Diane telephoned him sounding \"very upset\" and asked him to come over. She baked cookies shortly after his arrival, and they sat up all night talking. About 9 a.m., Edward Durston told detectives, Diane Linkletter went into her kitchen and didn't return. Durston went looking for her but failed to \"reach her as she approached the window,\" according to the report he gave Los Angeles homicide detective Lt. Norman Hamilton. \"She went over to a window. I tried to grab her and she went out,\" said Durston. She was found lying on the sidewalk immediately below her kitchen window minutes later. After interviewing Durston at the scene, Lt. Hamilton was convinced the girl had been in a \"despondent, depressed, emotional state,\" that she was \"concerned with her identity, her career,\" and that she had complained she \"could not be her own person.\" Diane's statements, as reported by Durston to the police, depict a young woman desperately unhappy with her life and ultimately determined to end her sufferings. Durston made no mention of her saying she was feeling the effects of any drug she might have taken, or that she was experiencing flashbacks to earlier drug trips (points that will become important later in this story). According to statements made by Art Linkletter to the media, Diane had called her brother, Robert (24), just shortly before 9 a.m. on the morning she died, and he was hurrying to her side at the time she jumped. Art Linkletter asserted in subsequent interviews that Diane had taken LSD the night before her death, with her panic over its effects leading to the fatal plunge. (Art spoke for the family on the subject of Diane's death. It appears, however, he was relying upon Robert's account of his phone call with Diane for that tidbit of information. By all accounts, Art Linkletter hadn't had direct contact with his daughter during the last twenty-four hours of her life.) Edward Durston's account of that morning (as provided in the news stories at the time, which, admittedly, might not record everything that was significant) made no mention of Diane telephoning her brother. According to Robert Linkletter, however, after he spoke with Diane, he then spoke with Durston, asking Durston if he could handle things until Robert got there. We don't know if Robert Linkletter's account of a phone call between himself and Diane should be trusted. That this piece of information is missing from Durston's account casts doubt on its having taken place. Even if the call had really was made, we don't know what was said. A suicidal Diane might have chosen to bid her brother good-bye rather than report (as claimed) that she was having flashbacks and needed help beyond what Durston was providing. Whatever the truth of the phone call that may or may not have been made, Robert's account of it appears to be the source of all claims that Diane's death was related to LSD, both the original claims that she had taken drugs the night before and died while on an out-of-control trip, and the later claims that she had experienced flashbacks from a bad trip taken six months earlier and was panicked into taking her own life. (The story changed once Diane was autopsied and the results of toxicological tests became known. Nothing unusual turned up in the screening, thus ruling out her having taken drugs that night.) We don't know if Diane was experiencing a flashback at the time of her death, or even if LSD flashbacks are possible. (That point is hotly disputed in the drug community: some say they're real, some say they're an impossibility, ascribing first-person accounts to psychosomatic suggestion.) We don't even know if she'd actually ever taken LSD at any time in her life, since the only accounts that she had came from her family in the aftermath of her death. What we do know is she wasn't on drugs at the time of her death. As for whether she was under the infuence of LSD through a flashback to an earlier trip, we know from Durston's account of her demeanor that her behavior was not consistent with that of someone flipped out on acid. She instead presented as someone despondent and overwhelmed. Art Linkletter (who was with his wife and another daughter in Colorado at the time of Diane's death), claimed within scant hours of the tragedy that Diane had been under the influence of LSD when she jumped, maintaining: \"It isn't suicide because she wasn't herself. It was murder. She was murdered by the people who manufacture and sell LSD.\" Linkletter made this statement — which would be widely repeated and relied upon as the cause of her death — before an autopsy had even been started. He went on to say that he had known for six months Diane had experimented with LSD before. According to him, Diane had experienced \"minor problems\" six months before her death and had sought relief from them through LSD; instead of relief, however, she found a bad trip which left her hallucinating long after the effects of the drug should have worn off. Diane's \"bad trip\" hasn't been confirmed by anyone else, although her father made constant reference to it AFTER her death. (He is quoted in the April 1970 issue of Good Housekeeping, for example, as saying \"Diane herself, six months before her death, had told us she had tried LSD and had had a bad trip. We sat down and talked for a long time, and she agreed it was a dangerous and stupid thing to do; that she wouldn't do it again. And I don't think she did, although I can't be sure.\") Was Diane a drug user with a history of bad trips, and did remnants of one of them ultimately work to impel her to take her own life? Or did a famous family which had weathered the shock of another suicide just three months earlier invent a story that would allow them to present their deceased child as a victim of society's ills and not as an emotionally unstable young woman overwhelmed by the pressures upon her to succeed and by her own inability to make much of a mark in the world independent of her family? Or did brother Robert, when called upon to deliver horrifying news to his parents, invent a scenario on the spur of the moment that would help soften the blow? (Three months earlier, on 15 July 1969, the family had endured a similar loss when John Zweyer, 33, husband of Art Linkletter's oldest daughter, Dawn, shot himself in the head in the backyard of his Hollywood home. He had reportedly grown despondent over his insurance business.) Whatever the reason for the unshakeable conviction Diane's death was drug-related, this belief motivated her father to become a crusader in the war against drugs. He lectured ceaselessly for the cause, and his speeches and writings on the topic are as fairly presented, persuasive, and non-preaching as any that could be produced by one who passionately believes in a cause and is determined to spare others the tragedy he has known. Art Linkletter's ability to speak directly to others as a grieving father cast adrift in a world of no clear answers yet permeated by a clear and present danger that could strike in any home gave him the power to be heard. Some have accused him of turning Diane's casket into a podium, but even if that's true, he has certainly made effective and excellent use of it. Even prior to his daughter's death, however, Art Linkletter was vitally concerned with what he saw as the eroding state of family values, and he was actively engaged in lecturing across country on the chosen topic of \"Permissiveness in this Society.\" (Indeed, he'd been in Colorado to deliver such a talk at the time of Diane's death.) He had also just released a record called \"A Letter to a Teenager\" (also known as \"We Love You; Call Collect\"). The flip side contained a rebuttal performed by Diane, which was called \"Dear Mom and Dad.\" (Both had been recorded a year or two earlier. The record went on to win \"Best Spoken Word Recording\" 1969 Grammy honors.) Martin Wark wrote these words for the father in the piece, played by Art: \"There can be harm in doing too much, and danger in doing too little. A time for holding on and a time for letting go. Some day you too will discover how much courage letting go takes . . . Your generation wants to be left alone. They want it so that each can find his own thing. But where is this thing for which they search?\" And he wrote these for the daughter, played by Diane: \"Since I split, I know I have to find things out for myself. . . I'm living with some kids in a big old house, and we help each other. Since being away I've met a lot of weirdos, pot smokers and speed freaks. But I've found out how to tell the beautiful people from the phonies. I may come home some day, but right now I've got to do what's right for me.\" Diane didn't live long enough to figure out what was right for her. One of her friends, Katherine Oliver, said Diane was \"always searching for something she couldn't find.\" Barbara \"search and unrescued\" Mikkelson Sightings: A Philadelphia-based band has adopted the name of \"The Diane Linkletter Experience.\" In 1969, John Waters produced The Diane Linkletter Story, a short film (starring Divine) based on a fictionalized account of the events surrounding Diane's death.

"Barbara Mikkelson" 2000-12-17 "An old woman traveling in a car filled with relatives dies during a long journey. The surviving family members place her corpse on the car's roof rack, cover it with a tarp, and continue on. Upon reaching the nearest town, the family stops for a coffee and something to eat, leaving Granny's remains tied to the roof rack. They return to the parking lot to find their vehicle — and their dead relative — gone." "Claim: An old woman traveling in a car filled with relatives dies during a long journey. The surviving family members place her corpse on the car's roof rack, cover it with a tarp, and continue on. Upon reaching the nearest town, the family stops for a coffee and something to eat, leaving Granny's remains tied to the roof rack. They return to the parking lot to find their vehicle — and their dead relative — gone. LEGEND Examples:  This story was told me by my cousin, who had heard it from a friend in Leeds, about a couple whom he knew, who went for a camping holiday in Spain with their car. They had taken his stepmother with them. She slept in a different tent to the others. On the morning that they struck [broke camp], they were very busy, and they didn't hear anything of her for a while, and then, when they went to her tent, they found she had died, and rigor had already set in. They were in a great state, and they didn't know what to do, but they decided to roll her up in the tent, and put her on top of the car, and go to the nearest town, and go to the consul and the police. So they did this, and went to the town, and then they felt very cold and miserable, and they hadn't had a proper breakfast. So they thought they'd get a cup of coffee to revive them, before they went in search of the consul. So they parked the car, and went to a small cafe, and had their cup of coffee, and then came back to look for the car. But it wasn't there. It had gone. So they went home to England without the car or the stepmother. But the difficulty was, they couldn't prove [probate] her will.
 
 [Emrich, 1972] It happened to a family friend as they were traveling across the desert to California. Within this station wagon there was a father, a mother and their children, and the mother-in-law who everyone called \"Grandma.\" And as they were going across the desert Grandma became sick and she died. Now they didn't want to alarm the children and they didn't want to leave Grandma out in the desert so the only place they had room for her where she — her smell wouldn't bother the children — was to strap her on top of the station wagon along with the baggage with a tarp over her, of course. And as they were traveling across the desert they kept looking for a town where they could deposit Grandma. They finally arrived in a small town in Arizona where they stopped at a filling station and they went in to report Grandma's death. And while they were within the filling station somebody stole the station wagon and when they went out — no station wagon and no Grandma! Well, it wasn't very funny even though it sounds like it because they have to wait seven years now to prove that Grandma is dead before they can collect any insurance. And they've never been able to find either the car or Grandma. This actually happened. They couldn't leave Grandma out in the desert. Not only because — uh — it wasn't right to leave a body out in the desert but also for insurance and also to prove it wasn't murder and also to prove there was a body in any court proceedings.
 
 [Healey and Glanvill, 1996] There was a family from Surrey who decided to spend their vacation in France, taking their elderly grandma with them. Granny spent all their stay complaining. Well, not quite all of it, because a little way into the holiday, she died on them. Deciding that the old woman would hate not to be buried in her beloved Blighty, the family set about returning her home, and, mindful of the customs and other problems they might face, they resolved to hide her. So they bought a cheap bit of carpet, and rolled the wrinkled little corpse up in it. Granny's body was by now too stiff to bend on to a car seat, so they had to strap her on the roof-rack. In this way she was driven across France for two days, through driving rain and baking sunshine, across the Channel by ferry, and finally all the way home. Unhappily, having made it back without a hitch, the family were devastated when, after a well-earned cuppa, they went outside to find the car stolen — carpet, Granny and all. And they were never recovered.  Variations:   tensions involved in crossing international borders, while North American renditions rarely mention borders at all. The primary focus in American tales is the inconvenience of dear old gran's death.     happened. European renditions generally end with the family's discovery of the theft, a detail possibly related to why the body is being transported in the first place (usually out of filial desire to do right by the departed by bringing her home for proper burial). North American tellings, however, often end with the realization that inability to produce the body will lead to difficulty collecting the inheritance. In those versions, the corpse was being carted around the countryside usually only out of desire to dump it at the first appropriate spot. Unlike the dead cat in the package legend, scant thought is given in this story to the thief's projected reaction upon discovering what he made off with. The focus stays upon the family's woes, first in having to transport the corpse, then in having to explain the theft to the authorities. Folklorists have advanced differing theories about what lies at the heart of this legend: fear of the dead (without a proper burial, Granny may return to haunt her offspring), disgust with the elderly (at least now she's not sitting in the car), and distrust of authorities (fear of customs and border officials). It might be much simpler than all that. Throughout the legend's numerous tellings, Granny is never once portrayed as loved and valued, someone whose loss is felt and indeed mourned. Those left to cope with her death treat her as a non-person — their major concern becomes what to do with the decaying body, not how to come to terms with the passing of someone deeply cared about. There's no sense of tears being shed; it's all bundle up the body and get rid of it. Even in the odd telling where mention is made of the family being thrown into a great state by the discovery of Granny's demise, the focus is on their shock at happening upon a death and having to deal with the question of what to do with a corpse, not upon their grief over the loss of a family member. Figuratively a burden to the family during her life, Granny becomes a literal burden in death. Once deceased, she is dealt with in a manner reflective of how nuclear families often deal with their elderly — she's distanced from the vital center of the family and stashed out of sight. In reality, aging parents might be consigned to an old folks home wherein they receive a once-a-month duty call; in legend, the \"burden\" is packaged up for neat disposal and placed among the other baggage. The twist at the end of the North American versions becomes stunningly appropriate under that analysis — the theft of the body causes a delay in the probate of Granny's will. Only a body to them in death, Granny has her revenge upon her cold-hearted relatives — the lack of that very body keeps them from inheriting what they thought should by rights pass to them.

"David Mikkelson" 2000-11-24 "Drug users are disposing of their used needles by putting them into the coin return slots of public telephones, thereby infecting unsuspecting victims with hepatitis and HIV." "Original title: \"Slots of Fun\"Just when you thought it was safe to leave the house, out pops another breathless piece of scarelore warning us about a new appearance of that bogeyman of our era, AIDS. (A cousin to this scare has to do with deliberate infection of young people who are stabbed with contaminated needles by anonymous assailants at movie theatres and dance clubs. See our Pin Prick Attacks page for more about this related legend.) This time it's drug addicts placing their used, HIV-laden needles into pay phone coin slots in order to stab (and infect) hapless, innocent victims who want nothing more than to retrieve a coin or two and receive death sentences for their troubles. (Drug addicts have been using syringes and needles for decades — you have to wonder why they didn't start leaving them in Pepsi cans and pay phone coin slots until after AIDS came to world-wide attention.) We're told that this isn't a tale from some \"hearsay urban legend source,\" but rather from \"phone company workers, through the EMT instructor.\" In other words, the one and only source for this warning is an unnamed EMT instructor somewhere who heard it from an unidentified telephone company workers somewhere. You can't beat that as a reliable source ... Examples: [Collected on the Internet, 1998] A very good friend of mine is in an EMT certification course. There is something new happening that everyone should be aware of. Drug users are now taking their used needles and putting them into the coin return slots in public telephones. People are putting their fingers in to recover coins or just to check if anyone left change. They are getting stuck by these needles and infected with hepatitis, HIV, and other diseases. This message is posted to make everyone aware of this danger. Be aware! The change isn't worth it! P.S. - This information came straight from phone company workers, through the EMT instructor. This did NOT come from a hearsay urban legend source.
 [Collected via e-mail, October 2007] World Health Organization Warning Very troubling important message! This happened in the St. Bruno area of Montreal just a few days ago in a movie theater. A person sat down on something sharp on the seat. Upon examination, it turned out to be a needle with a note attached: You have just been infected with HIV. The Center for Disease control reports several similar events recently in other cities. All the needles tested positive. The center reports that needles were also found in the coin return section of public telephones, as well as in the coin return section of soft drink machines. They are asking everyone to exercise extreme prudence in these situations. All public seating should be carefully scrutinized before using. A very careful visual inspection should suffice. Furthermore, you are asked to communicate this notice of potential danger to all your family and friends and as many people as possible. This notice is so important, you can save even one person from this danger by circulating this warning. Please, take a few seconds right now to pass this one.<img src=\"https://www.snopes.com/uploads/images/horrors/graphics/payphone.gif\" alt=\"Payphone\" width=\"75\" height=\"187\" align=\"RIGHT\" border=\"0\" hspace=\"16\" vspace=\"16\" /> To date, there are no known instances of contaminated needles turning up in pay phone coin returns, let alone an unsuspecting telephone user's being infected by one. \"We have been looking at all of our phones and have not found a single instance of where this has happened,\" Bell Atlantic spokesman Cliff Lee said in a November 1998 article in The Buffalo News. A December 1998 article in the Chicago Tribune stated: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control has no reports of any such infection, nor does the Howard Brown Memorial Health Center in Chicago that treats many HIV cases. The Illinois, Cook County and Chicago Departments of Public Health and the Chicago Police Department have no records of any such incidents.The Illinois Public Telecommunications Association, an umbrella group representing about 150 coin-operated phone companies, has no reports of needles found in pay phones, and Ameritech says that in our five-state region only once, more than two years ago, did someone find a hypodermic needle in a coin slot. That person was not stuck. On 9 February 1999 two people were injured in Pulaski, Virginia, when they put their fingers into the coin return slots of pay telephones and were jabbed by (uncontaminated) needles left in those slots. The next day, four hypodermic needles were found — wrapped in cotton, thus not presenting much of a danger to anyone — in post office mail slots and a night deposit box in nearby Wythe County. No one was infected or seriously injured in those incidents. Did the legend come true? We doubt it. You see, six days earlier the major newspaper of that area carried an article about this very legend, exposing it as a hoax. Most likely a prankster or two read it and decided to pull some legs. On 29 October 2009 a student at Middle State Tennessee University was stuck by a hypodermic needle after reaching into the change dispenser of a Pepsi machine located on campus. She was treated at Middle Tennessee Medical Center and later released. Police are examining the syringe. A second syringe was discovered on 4 November 2009 in a \"Vitamin Water\" vending machine at that college's student center. No one was injured in that incident. In 2000, some thoughtful soul re-worked the original scare about coin returns on pay phones into one focused on a variety of vending machines and set it in Canada: [Collected on the Internet, 2000] I am forwarding this email about something really scary I heard about today. Because it is certainly worth about, I am sending this out to you . . . Please read the following anecdote: On an average day in your life, you are out and decide you are thirsty. You notice a pop machine in your surroundings. You go over to the pop machine, & drop in a loonie. After collecting your beverage, you reach in the little compartment to collect your 50 cents change. Once reaching in, you feel a sharp prick on the finger you inserted into the change box. Your finger is bleeding, you bend down to look inside the small area to see what pricked you. What you see is a small needle, with a note beside it: \"YOU NOW HAVE THE H.I.V. VIRUS\", it reads. ***This is not some scary fiction story! THIS IS NOW HAPPENING IN ALBERTA!!!... Please read on and then pass this warning to people you care about. At our student council meeting this afternoon, our advisor (a teacher at the school) told us that last week, she received a phone call from a friend at the University of Lethbridge. THE ABOVE SCENARIO HAPPENED THERE RECENTLY at the University of Lethbridge) !!! How many it happened to or why not many have heard about it is beyond me, but THIS IS REALLY HAPPENING!!!!!!!!!!! Police suspect that this is the work of a particular cult in western Canada. It (these incidents) began in Saskatchewan and have now spread into Alberta. The prime targets are major cities, but there's no saying that it couldn't occur in smaller towns. It happened in Lethbridge and they are on the alert especially in Edmonton and Calgary. What happens is that somehow someone inserts a syringe or a needle/pin that has been infected with the HIV virus into a vending machine compartment. Beside it they leave a note saying that whomever has been pricked and is now infected. I KNOW IT SOUNDS CRAZY, BUT TAKING A PEEK INTO ANY COMPARTMENT OF ANY PUBLIC MACHINE (PAY-PHONE,POP MACHINE, VENDING MACHINE) *** BEFORE STICKING YOUR HAND IN THERE COULD SAVE YOUR LIFE *** Whether it is where you'd get your change, or where you'd reach in and collect a can of pop or pick up a bag of chips... Be on the look-out for a note or a needle. In order for someone to read the note or get pricked by the needle, they must be in a place where, if they checked first, anyone could see it. ***Don't let yourself become a victim & Please PASS on!!!*** Despite the forceful claims made in this later version of the \"AIDS needle found in coin return\" scare, there have not been any such incidents in Edmonton, Calgary, or any other Canadian cities. Moreover, officials of the University of Lethbridge (Alberta) have been bedeviled by inquiries about this story since it first appeared on the Internet. All who have asked have been told the same thing: There haven't been any such attacks on their campus.

This newer version of the \"AIDS needle found in coin return\" tale incorporates the \"AIDS announcement note\" motif of the earliest AIDS urban legend, the venerable AIDS Mary.

"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/black-agnes/" "legend" "Horror legend holds that a teenage girl was found dead in the arms of a graveyard statue." "Barbara Mikkelson" 2000-11-05 "A teenage girl who bets her friends she can spend the night in a cemetery is found dead in the arms of a graveyard statue." "Told as having happened in various parts of the United States, this legend has been with us for quite a while. The victim is always a teenage girl, and a sorority initiation dare is what usually serves to impel her to sit in the statue's lap. The flourish in the example below that tells of the girl being related to the man who'd done the ghost wrong is unusual: most versions make no mention of a connection between victim and murderous spirit. (It's probably more frightening that way, because then the victim could very well be anyone.) A marble gravestone in an old deserted cemetery in West Virginia was the legend trip site for a particular group of young adults in the vicinity. The marble statue was of a seated lady, her hands outstretched to all that pass by the resting place. The legend stated that the woman in the grave had died of a broken heart when jilted by her fiancé. The legend trip was an initiation rite: new members had to spend the night sitting in the statue's lap. But the last time anyone tried this, the young woman who sat in the statue's lap met with a tragedy. The difference, you see, was that the young woman was a direct descendant of the fiancé! The next morning the young girl was discovered, still sitting in the statue's lap. She was dead. On her body were found marks as though she had been held in a superhuman clutch. Perhaps the seated lady had gained revenge. Other versions have it that just falling under the statue's malevolent gaze is enough to seal one's fate: I remember reading a story about a graveyard in the Midwest (Chicago?) with a statue in it called \"Black Aggie\". It was said that if you fell under her gaze after dark, you would die. They say her eyes glow red at night. The \"killing statue\" story is closely related to another venerable legend, that of the girl who accepts a dare to spend a night in the graveyard. (Variations on its basic theme go back to the Middle Ages in Europe.) As part of the dare — or prompted by her own disrespect — she plunges a knife into a grave. In the morning she's found lying dead across the plot, the knife pinning her skirt to the ground having prevented her from escaping. Died of fright, they say, with a look of terror etched on her face. (One is left to work out whether a ghost had actually killed her, or whether her fear at finding herself held to the grave had done her in.) My grandmother used to tell this: A young girl had a pajama party with several of her teenage friends attending. Shortly before midnight she told her guests that there was a grave in the edge of the woods behind her house and anyone going there on a full moon and standing to close to the grave would be pulled into the grave by the bony hand of the old man buried there. One 15 year old girl scoffed at the story and after much teasing accepted the challenge of going alone to the grave. As proof she had actually gone all the way she was to stick a fork into the top of the grave for inspection by all the others the next morning. The girl left and did not return. The others mourned her absence until morning - afraid to wake the adults in the house - fearful they were in serious trouble. Next morning they all huddled together and nervously made their way to the grave. There they found their friend lying dead beside the grave with her long night gown pinned to the grave where she had stuck the fork thru her night gown and into the hard clay covering the grave. We all thought this was a true story until we got older. Getting back to killer statues, we note the legend of Black Agnes is peculiar to Baltimore, Maryland, and it sprang up around a sculpture that started out as a grave marker in Loudon Park Cemetery. The evocative statue of a seated, mournful figure of indeterminate gender was christened Black Aggie, and fraternity/sorority initiations sprang up around it. In an effort to thwart those rituals, Black Aggie was moved to Druid Hill Park. The problems continued there, so in 1967 the statue was dispatched to the Smithsonian Institution. She now resides at the federal courts building in Washington, D.C., off I Street, in a rear courtyard of the Dolley Madison House. The statue did once mark a final resting place in Baltimore — but not of a woman, as you might suppose. No, the person buried under Aggie was Felix Agnus (1839-1925), a Union Civil War general. Facts be damned though, kids were determined to believe Aggie was the representation of the person in the grave, and further that the dead person had died a heartbroken woman, hence her need to wreak vengeance from the other side. Aggie's eyes were said to burn bright red at midnight, permanently blinding anyone foolish enough to look into them. Lying in her arms was said to be fatal. Up against that, a Civil War general wouldn't even register. Even if he were one that H.L. Mencken once said had so much lead in him that \"he rattled when he walked.\" Oddly enough, the statue that started out in Baltimore and ended up in Washington was a copy of one already in Washington. The original can be found in Rock Creek Cemetery, where it marks the graves of Marian and Henry Adams. In 1866, depressed by the death of her father, Marian Adams swallowed potassium cyanide while her husband was paying an emergency Sunday visit to his dentist. Grief-stricken over her loss to the end of his life, Adams commissioned a special monument from the well-known sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens. The statue has come to be called \"Grief,\" although it never was officially so named either by its creator or its patron. There is no writing to be found on it, so very few know it's actually the grave marker of both Henry and Marian (he joined her underneath there in 1918) and not just a lovely bit of statuary. It's ironic that the original statue (which is erected over the grave of a grief-stricken woman) never became a target either for fraternity initiation rites or for murdering ghost legends, whereas the Baltimore copy (erected over the grave of Civil War General who'd lived a full and rewarding life) did. Just goes to show that facts never get in the way of a good ghost story. A number of communities have \"killer statue\" legends, and Black Agnes is only one of them. Adding to the confusion is the superimposing of one legend onto another. A scary pre-teen belief has it that chanting \"Bloody Mary\" or \"I believe in Mary Worth\" a specified number of times in front of a darkened mirror will cause a vengeful spirit to appear. At times this gets crossed up with Black Agnes legends and the chant is rendered as \"Black Aggie\" or \"Black Agnes.\"" 2000 "Nov" 11 1830

"Barbara Mikkelson" 2000-11-03 "Women who wear their purses strapped across their bodies running the risk of being beheaded by purse snatchers." "Claim: Women who wear their purses strapped across their bodies running the risk of being beheaded by purse snatchers. Status: False. Example: [Collected on the Internet, 2000]  I just saw a segment of \"Oprah\" reporting on the deaths of at least 14 women in the United States due to broken necks from usually harmless purse snatching!! Women who wear their purse straps across their chests rather than over their shoulders are at risk for broken necks and, possibly, decapitation!! Purse snatchers' usual method of operation involves approaching an unsuspecting woman, quickly pulling her purse from her shoulder, and fleeing the scene. Purse snatchers do not check to see if the purse is around the woman's neck first!! Purse straps will not break, your neck most likely will! Fourteen women have already died!! Beware!!! The first reported case of a purse strap-related death occurred in Los Angeles in 1987. A young woman was leaving a local mall when a man mistakenly broke her neck in an attempt to steal her purse, which was holding a measly $20!!!!! X-rays revealed the woman's neck was nearly severed in two! Another woman in 1988 suffered not only a twice fractured neck bone, but a completely shattered jaw! One woman survived this grisly ordeal only to be left quadriplegic for life!! The scariest news is that with purse snatching on the rise, 6 cases were reported just over the past year!!! Remember this: more purse snatchings are reported during Christmas time than any other season. Please tell your mothers, daughters, sisters, and friends: DO NOT WEAR YOUR PURSE STRAP ACROSS YOUR CHEST!
 Origins: This advisory  appeared on the Internet in November 2000. Despite the unsigned e-mail's claim that The Oprah Winfrey Show recently aired a segment about purse-snatching deaths, the show's transcription service does not list any episode in the year prior to the e-mail even remotely matching this description. Once again, a baseless bit of rumormongering had been bolstered by specious claims that the writer had gained his information from a popular TV talk show and was now passing it along as a public service. In effect, Oprah's hard-won credibility was used to prop up someone else's baloney. Purse-snatching fatalities have occurred, but not because victims were wearing bags strapped across their bodies and thus were choked to death or decapitated by the straps. The few such fatalities on record involved victims who either would not or could not let go of the bag and were knocked down and dragged by the thieves trying to pry it loose, or who were hit by their assailants. The fatalities described in this \"Warning To Women!\" look to have been invented to make gals act on the advice being offered: \"Don't strap your purse across your body.\" Claims that \"The first reported case of a purse strap-related death occurred in Los Angeles in 1987\" and \"deaths of at least 14 women in the United States due to broken necks\" just don't hold up upon examination. Likewise, any woman who's ever owned a handbag knows \"Purse straps will not break\" just isn't true. (Our favorite howler: \"X-rays revealed the woman's neck was nearly severed in two!\" Even in Los Angeles, medical staff are capable of recognizing this condition without the benefit of x-rays.) Though the details of the alert are clearly false, the advice being offered is actually worthwhile. Purse snatchers from the \"grab and go\" school have injured victims when those being robbed couldn't quickly get loose from their handbags. A gal who wears her purse strapped across her runs the risk of being dragged along as the thief tries to get away with the booty. Serious injuries and even deaths have occurred from such draggings. If your purse is being snatched, let it go. Whatever's in there is not worth being hurt over. Better still, a variety of law enforcement agencies offer the following tips on how to avoid becoming the victim of a pickpocket or purse snatcher:             DON'TS:        Barbara \"loose me from this guy and diamonds\" Mikkelson Last updated: 28 July 2006

"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/window-strength-death/" "true" "A Toronto lawyer demonstrating the safety of window panes in a skyscraper ironically plunged through a window to his death." "Snopes Staff" 2000-11-02 "A Toronto lawyer demonstrating the safety of window panes in a skyscraper plunged through a window to his death." "It isn't often we have occasion to employ the term \"accidental self-defenestration\" in an article, but that phrase certainly applies to the case of Garry Hoy, a 38-year-old lawyer with the Toronto law firm of Holden Day Wilson, who on 9 July 1993 plunged to his death from the 24th floor of the Toronto-Dominion Bank Tower building at TD Centre in front of several horrified witnesses: Police said a lawyer demonstrating the safety of windows in a downtown Toronto skyscraper crashed through a pane with his shoulder and plunged 24 floors to his death. A police spokesman said Garry Hoy fell into the courtyard of the Toronto Dominion Bank Tower early Friday evening as he was explaining the strength of the building's windows to visiting law students. Hoy previously had conducted demonstrations of window strength according to police reports. Peter Lauwers, managing partner of the firm Holden Day Wilson, told the Toronto Sun newspaper that Hoy was \"one of the best and brightest\" members of the 200-man association. For motivations that remain unclear to this day Hoy had apparently developed a fondness for showing off the tensile strength of office building windows (and/or demonstrating his fearless trust in that aspect of building design) by running and hurling himself at window panes in front of onlookers, who would watch a stunt that always ended with Hoy's bouncing off of the window panes, leaving both glass and lawyer unharmed. On a fateful day in 1993, however, Hoy attempted his feat in front of a group of prospective legal apprentices with disastrous results: Apparently the first attempt came off as usual with Hoy harmlessly rebounding off the window, but when Hoy threw himself against the pane a second time, it popped out of its frame and sent Hoy fatally tumbling 24 stories to the courtyard below. <center><IMG ALT=\"Falling man\" SRC=\"https://www.snopes.com/uploads/images/horrors/graphics/suicide2.jpg\" style=\"border:1px solid black\"></center> The firm's spokesperson said Hoy \"... was testing the strength of the window. There was a lot of joking about how the window wouldn't open maybe on a hot day ... Apparently, it was the second attempt [at testing the window] that one of them popped out and he went through.\" As well, a Toronto police officer reported that Hoy \"... was showing his knowledge of the tensile strength of window glass and presumably the glass gave way. I know the frame and the blinds are still there.\" As the Torontoist reported of the incident years later: We can never know what motivated Hoy: a desire to prove the robustness of modern construction techniques, whimsey, or just simply showing off. We do know that his early demise could have been avoided had he left the testing to the experts. Or consulted with structural engineer Bob Greer, who later told the Toronto Star \"I don't know of any building code in the world that would allow a 160-pound man to run up against a glass and withstand it.\" Sadly, Hoy's tragic accident led not only to his own demise but was also a contributing factor in the closure a few years later of the firm that had employed him: [Prior to 2007], the biggest law firm to shut down was Toronto-based Holden Day Wilson LLP in 1996. Holden Day at its peak had 90 lawyers after a merger in 1990, but the firm was devastated in 1993 by a fatal accident involving popular partner, Garry Hoy, who playfully took a run at a window during a reception at the Toronto-Dominion Centre. In front of dozens of lawyers, the window gave way and Mr. Hoy fell to his death 24 floors below. The combined challenge of recovering from Mr. Hoy's death and holding together a newly merged firm proved too great for Holden Day's partners. By 1996, more than 30 partners had left the firm, and Holden Day closed its doors amid controversy about unpaid bills and compensation. Our advice is to apply the same rule to architecture as you do to computers: Don't ever bet your life on windows not crashing." 2000 "Nov" 11 1990

"Snopes Staff" 2000-11-01 "Police have documented cases of people randomly distributing poisoned goodies to children on Halloween." "Tales of black-hearted madmen doling out poisoned Halloween candy to unsuspecting little tykes have been around for decades — they were part of my Halloween experience more than forty years ago. And every year sees the same flurry of activity in response to such rumors: radio, TV and newspapers issue dark warnings about tampered candy and suggest taking the little ones to parties instead of collecting goodies door-to-door. Even Ann Landers published a column in 1995 warning us against the mad poisoner, saying, \"In recent years, there have been reports of people with twisted minds putting razor blades and poison in taffy apples and Halloween candy.\" (Recent years? Poison?) It's a sadness that a holiday so thoroughly and greedily enjoyed by kids is being sanitized out of existence in the name of safety. Sadder still is there appears to be little reason for it. Though we've yet to find evidence of a genuine Halloween poisoning, we have uncovered a few isolated incidents initially reported as random poisonings that, upon further investigation, turned out to be something else. Let's set the criteria for what constitutes a Halloween poisoning and then examine the famous and not-so-famous cases often pointed to as examples of this horror: To qualify as a Halloween poisoning, poisoned candy has to be handed out on a random basis to children as part of the trick-or-treating ritual inherent to Halloween. The act cannot be targeted to any one specific child. By far the most famous case of Halloween candy poisoning was the murder of eight-year-old Timothy Marc O'Bryan at the hands of his father, Ronald Clark O'Bryan, in Houston, Texas. The child died at 10 p.m. on 31 October 1974, as a result of eating cyanide-laced Pixie Stix acquired while trick-or-treating. To make his act appear more like the work of a random madman, O'Bryan also gave poisoned Pixie Stix to his daughter and three other children. By a kind stroke of fate, none of the other children ate the candy. The prosecution proved the father had purchased cyanide and had (along with a neighbor) accompanied the group of children on their door-to-door mission. None of the places visited that night were giving out Pixie Stix. Young Mark's life was insured for a large sum of money, and collecting on this policy has always been pointed to as the motive behind this murder. Though the case was circumstantial (no one saw the father poison the candy or slip the Pixie Stix into the boy's bag), Ronald O'Bryan was convicted of the murder in May 1975. He received the death sentence and was executed by lethal injection on 31 March 1984 (not on the poetically-just 31 October as is often recounted in off-the-cuff retellings of the case). The O'Bryan murder was an attempt to use a well-known urban legend to cover up the premeditated murder of one particular child. (Note that for this explanation of the boy's murder to have been believed, the legend had to have been in wide circulation by 1974.) Though cold-blooded and horrible to contemplate, this crime still does not qualify as a genuine Halloween poisoning because there was nothing random about Timothy O'Bryan's death. (The specter of the mad poisoner from the 1982 Tylenol murders was similarly employed by various murderers attempting to cover their tracks.) Another attempt to obscure the circumstances surrounding a little boy's death by invoking this legend took place in Detroit in 1970. On 2 November 1970, 5-year-old Kevin Toston lapsed into a coma and died four days later of a heroin overdose. Analysis of some of his Halloween candy showed it had been sprinkled with heroin. This case was widely reported as a real-life example of Halloween sadism. Not nearly so widely circulated were the results of the police investigation, which concluded the boy had accidentally got into his uncle's heroin stash and poisoned himself, and that the family had sprinkled heroin on the kid's candy after the fact to protect the uncle. Antedating both these stories is the odd case of Helen Pfeil, a Greenlawn, N.Y. housewife who was arrested in 1964 for handing out arsenic-laced ant poison buttons as part of a self-evident Halloween joke. Annoyed that many of the trick-or-treaters were too old to be asking for free candy, she made up packages of inedible \"treats\" to give to the teenagers. The packages contained dog biscuits, steel wool pads and the ant buttons (which were clearly marked \"Poison\" and labeled with a skull and crossbones). She also took the precaution of telling the teenagers that the packages were a joke when she handed them out, and there is no record of anyone's being harmed by her actions. Even so, the potential for harm was there so she was charged. She pled guilty to endangering children and eventually received a suspended sentence. What initially appeared to be a (non-Halloween) random poisoning attempt aimed at children occurred in Emerson, N.J. On 8 October 1988, The New York Times said traces of strychnine were found in a box of Sunkist Fun Fruits Dinosaurs purchased on September 23 in a New Jersey grocery. The suspicious powder the State Police lab had initially labeled strychnine was retested by the Food and Drug Administration and pronounced corn starch. The New York Times printed the updated version of the story on 14 October 1988, but not before Thomas J. Lipton Inc. (the manufacturer of Fun Fruits) destroyed 9400 cases of the product. The company maintained that the negative publicity surrounding this story had an adverse effect on their image. Though it's impossible to accurately measure such things, I believe their claim has merit. It's human nature to recall the destruction of the candy but forget it was a false alarm, and it is only reasonable to assume their image was somewhat damaged. (Those initial \"Oh my god!\" news stories do a fair deal of damage because bits of them stay in the average person's memory whereas retractions or follow-ups do not. Since they lend apparent credence to a myth that's already believed, these \"facts\" don't get discarded when new information comes along.) After Halloween 1994, a three-year-old New Britain, Connecticut, child was diagnosed as suffering from cocaine poisoning. Though he'd been sick earlier in the day and also had a habit of putting anything he found in his mouth, the finger was immediately pointed at tampered Halloween candy (with all the usual attendant media hysteria). More than a week later the local police announced that no traces of cocaine or any other drugs had been found on the leftover piece of candy that was supposed to have poisoned the boy. In 1982 the police of Redford Township (Detroit) had to issue a similar statement after a youth there became ill and his doctor misread initial lab results and then went public with charges of cyanide poisoning and doctored Halloween candy. Tests done on the lad to determine what was wrong were inconclusive, and later FDA tests of the candy turned up no contamination whatsoever. Another suspected Halloween poisoning occurred in Washington, DC in 1991. 31-year-old Kevin Michael Cherry of Montgomery County coincidentally died of heart failure after eating some of his child's Halloween loot. As told in the 2 November 1991 Washington Times, anxious parents dumped pounds of their kids' candy before the true cause of death was determined by autopsy. A further Halloween scare case was that of Ariel Katz, a 7-year-old Santa Monica girl who died of congenital heart failure on 31 October 1990 while trick-or-treating. The police feared a mass random poisoning and acted immediately on what they suspected, as reported in the 2 November 1990 Los Angeles Times: Santa Monica police had conducted an intense door-to-door search on the street where the youngster collapsed. They feared that other children might have picked up tainted Halloween candy, and they blocked off the 700 block of 12th Street for several hours while they confiscated candy and interviewed residents and revelers. Seven-year-old Ferdinan Siquig of San Jose, CA. collapsed on 31 October 1996 after eating candy and cookies he was given while trick-or-treating. Initial urine analysis at the hospital revealed traces of cocaine. Subsequent tests done by outside labs came back negative, and it was further concluded that the initial test results were wrong, but this conclusion was reached at least a day after the media had picked up on the story and scared the bejeezus out of everyone yet again with tales of a poisoner on the loose. In 2001, four-year-old Tiffaney Troung of Vancouver died a day after ingesting candy she picked up trick-or-treating on Halloween. Police reacted by issuing an alert to area parents to dump whatever goodies their kids had collected. The cause of death was ultimately pegged as non-contagious sepsis-causing streptococcus bacteria (which can cause everything from strep throat to flesh-eating disease). The Halloween candy Tiffaney ate played no part in her death. An odd act of randomness occurred in the town of Hercules, California (near San Francisco) in 2000. Some trick-or-treaters came home with little packets of marijuana done up to look like miniature Snickers bars. Parents of the kids who received this beneficence quickly contacted the police, who just as quickly traced the giveaway to a particular house. There, a mystified homeowner was confronted about the find. Police investigated and were satisfied the homeowner had no knowledge of the special contents of certain bars that were handed out that night. The marijuana packets dressed up to look like Snickers bars had landed in the Hercules dead letter office because whoever had tried to mail a package containing them either didn't use enough postage or had listed an incorrect address. A postal employee (the mystified homeowner) charged with transporting the bars plus various canned goods that had accumulated in the dead letter office to a local charity kept the candy for his own use. He brought the \"candy\" home to give out on Halloween, thinking the Snickers bars were, well, Snickers bars. The \"trick\" ended up being on him. Putting the crazed Halloween poisoner story to rest can be quite the task, as was outlined in a 9 November 1989 article in the Los Angeles Times. The following is an excerpt from an interview with Joel Best, a professor of sociology at California State University, Fresno, who has been trying to debunk this urban legend for more than thirty years: \"We checked major newspapers from throughout the country from 1958 through 1988,\" he said, \"assuming that any story this horrible would certainly be well reported.\" Well, they found a total of 78 cases and two deaths. [The two deaths Best was referring to were the O'Bryan murder and the accidental poisoning of Kevin Toston.] Further checking proved that almost all of the 78 cases were pranks. The deaths were tragically real, but they, too, were misrepresented in the beginning. The pranks, he said, were all of kids — after years of hearing similar stories — inserting needles or razor blades into fruit, not realizing (or maybe realizing) how much they frightened their whole town. \"My favorite,\" Best says, \"was the kid who brought a half-eaten candy bar to his parents and said, 'I think there's ant poison on this.' They had it checked and, sure enough, there was ant poison on it — significantly, on the end he had not bitten.\" Of course, the youngster had applied the poison himself. Best has tried mightily over the years to destroy this particular myth, but obviously to no avail. \"It's the old problem of trying to prove a negative,\" he says. Sad to say, foreign objects hidden in Halloween loot are part of the trick-or-treat experience, but these incidents are few and far between, and our fear of them is greatly out of proportion with the likelihood of their occurring. Acting on this out-of-control fear, some hospitals and police departments have taken to x-raying bags of Halloween plunder, as noted in the 31 October 1993 Washington Post: Of several contacted, only Maryland Hospital Center reported discovering what seemed to be a real threat — a needle detected by X-ray in a candy bar in 1988. But there was never an arrest or resolution in the case. In the ten years the National Confectioners Association has run its Halloween Hot Line, the group has yet to verify an instance of tampering, said spokesman Bill Sheehan. \"These myths become truisms.\" Sightings: This legend appears in a 1986 Jack Chick tract about the satanic influences of Halloween." 2000 "Nov" 11 1950

"Snopes Staff" 2000-11-01 "Pins, needles, and razor blades have been found in trick-or-treaters' loot." "Although random Halloween candy poisonings are confined to the realm of urban legendry, many actual cases of tampered trick-or-treat loot involving the insertion of pins, needles, or razor blades have been documented. These cases constitute a different class of tampering than poisoning for a couple of reasons. First, the expected level of harm is severely reduced: poison is an attempt to kill; a pin in an apple is an attempt to frighten or injure. Professor Joel Best reported that he was able to track about eighty cases of sharp objects in food incidents since 1959, and almost all were hoaxes. Only about ten culminated in even minor injury, and in the worst case, a woman required a few stitches. Compared to \"eat something and die,\" a couple of stitches barely registers on the scale. Second, the motivation for \"pins and needles\" tampering is different. As I said before, poison is an attempt to kill, but hiding a needle in an apple is almost always a prank, not a serious attempt to cause harm. (In those instances where such an insertion could be traced back to a specific person, it was almost always some kid intent on freaking out either his little brother or his parents or getting the community in an uproar as his version of a cute Halloween \"trick\"). Pranking (especially when it's a scary or slightly mean one) is part of Halloween, and the various kids or young adults who've tampered with treats most likely never fully considered the potential consequences of the joke prior to embarking on it. (When presented with a matchless opportunity to throw a scare into a pesky kid brother, who stops to think that Junior might get hurt?) According to the Minneapolis Star Tribune, an incident that broke with this expected pattern occurred in Minneapolis in 2000, when 49-year-old James Joseph Smith was charged with one count of adulterating a substance with intent to cause death, harm or illness after it was determined he'd put needles in Snickers bars and handed them out to children on Halloween. A 14-year-old boy was pricked by a needle hidden in a bar he'd bitten into, but no one required medical attention.  According to reporting found later in December 2000, Smith was perhaps on his way to an institution for the \"mentally ill\" after he was deemed \"incompetent for trial.\"  As author Jack Santino noted in his history of Halloween, \"pins and needles\" rumors began to supplant \"poisoned candy\" rumors in the mid-1960s, and nearly all such reports of such rumors proved to be hoaxes: Beginning in 1967 the focus of the legend shifted dramatically from poison to razors and sharp objects hidden in apples. The emergence of the razor blade motif remains to be studied, but it apparently spread rapidly in several areas of the eastern seaboard and Canada: The New York Times reported thirteen cases from isolated communities in New Jersey and noted \"several\" others in Ottawa and Toronto. Outrage was so strong in New Jersey that the state legislature passed a law shortly before Halloween 1968 mandating prison terms for those caught boobytrapping apples. This did not forestall the discovery of thirteen more apples with razor blades that year in five New Jersey counties. In many cases, The New York Times story noted that \"children were cut,\" but the more detailed accounts include suspicious details. In one case a boy came to his parents with an apple containing a razor blade. He had bit into an apple, he said, but not quite deeply enough to contact the blade. In another, the child said he found the blade while cutting out a rotten spot; in a third case, the razor was found when a child turned an apple over to his father for peeling. In all these detailed cases, the child was not injured, and because he was the immediate source of the apple, it seems possible that he was also the source of the blade. As Best and Horiuchi (authors of the Razor Blade) note, more than 75 percent of reported cases involved no injury, and detailed followups in 1972 and 1982 concluded that virtually all the reports were hoaxes concocted by the children or parents. Thus this legend type seems to have grown out of a tradition of ostensive hoaxes relying on an understood oral tradition, rather than on any core of authenticated incidents. Halloween of 1982 was the year it all went crazy. That year saw a number of tragic and random non-Halloween poisonings of both foodstuffs and medicines, including the Tylenol poisonings that killed seven people. Although the \"crazed madman tampering with kids' Halloween treats\" had been an established bogeyman for at least the previous fifteen years, it was in the aftermath of the Tylenol poisonings that a sudden spate of Halloween tampering reports erupted. It's as if the murder of those seven unfortunate people opened a forbidden door and now others were free to experiment with playing God, to dispense either life or death as the whim struck them." 2000 "Nov" 11 1950

"Barbara Mikkelson" 2000-10-16 "Rub-on \"tattoos\" of cartoon characters laced with LSD are handed out to children by unscrupulous drug dealers." "This bit of scarelore dates to at least the late 1970s, and it still makes little logical sense. A dealer looking to recruit new customers would do better to distribute a more addictive drug than LSD, handing out LSD-soaked candy would work far more effectively than passing around LSD-impregnated papers which require the drug to be absorbed through the skin, and elementary school kids are not known for having large incomes to spend on drugs. This \"warning\" also includes a legend within a legend: the notion that strychnine is present in LSD, either because it's a byproduct of the synthesis process, or because it's used to adulterate or \"cut\" the drug. Even if strychnine were present in LSD (for whatever reason), introducing your customers to the world of drugs by giving them samples laced with enough poison to kill them is an extremely poor way of generating repeat business.  Not surprisingly, no verified case of LSD-laced transfer tattoos has ever surfaced. The one bit of the story with anything genuine to it at all is the association between cartoon characters and LSD. Sometimes when the drug is manufactured by impregnating sheets of blotter paper with dots of liquid LSD, the paper is first printed with cartoon characters. This illustrated blotter acid, however, is ingested the usual way: the tab is chewed, then swallowed. Blurred photocopies of this specious warning against innocent children's being lured into a life of drug use via rub-on LSD-laced tattoos have been circulated everywhere. Back in the 1970s the image rumored to be used on these transfers was that of Mickey Mouse, but as times changed so did the image: the 1990s version of this tale saw Bart Simpson's name added to the list of potentially dangerous tattoos. These flyers have come to be known as \"Blue Star Acid\" warnings because even though the cartoon characters the tattoos purportedly depict have changed over the years, a blue star is the image most often cited as the one to look out for. This rumor spreads through communities like wildfire because, as always, anything that's perceived to be an immediate danger to children is taken very seriously and immediately passed on, no matter how implausible or unverified it may be. That these flyers are often issued with the imprimatur of the local police department (or some other important-sounding organization) makes them all them more believable to the public. By far the most common version of this alert is signed by a \"J. O'Donnell\" of the Outpatient Chemical Dependency Treatment Service at Danbury Hospital in Connecticut. Don't believe it. The hospital says it has never employed anyone by that name, and they've been inundated with Blue Star calls every year since 1992. Blue Star warnings tend to crop up every year as the kids are going back to school and seem to run strong right up until Halloween. Though Blue Star panics can occur at any time, the early fall is the season for them: Still, school officials insist they were just playing it safe, putting out a warning after receiving an alert from a concerned parent.\"If it's not true, that's terrific, but you like to err on the side of caution,\" said Islip Terrace Junior High School principal Bruce Castka. Though at first glance this seems a reasonable approach to take, it breaks down upon further examination. It comes down to a matter of credibility — lose it by panicking your kids over Blue Star Acid, and you won't have the support you need when you talk to them about things they should be in the know about. How authoritative will \"Yes, you can get pregnant the very first time, or you could even catch AIDS!\" sound when your little darlings can toss back at you, \"Oh, Mom! Don't you remember when you had us all going about LSD-laced tattoos?\" While protecting kids always has to be a priority, sometimes what they most need to be protected from is misinformation. Kids need to be able to trust what their parents and teachers tell them. Cry \"Wolf!\" once too often, and you send your kids defenseless into a world of lurking lupines they'll never recognize on their own. Here is a typical newspaper article appearing in the wake of yet another \"Blue Star Acid\" scare rolling through yet another town: It's not the first time the alarm bell has sounded. Nor will it likely be the last.In recent weeks, public and private schools have sent home frightening letters warning of drug-soaked fake tattoos and have been urging parents to spread the word. \"It's like a bad nightmare. This letter keeps resurfacing over a period of time,\" said Dr. Frank Bonfiglio, program director for the Middle Tennessee Poison Center of this urban folklore. But the letters, often circulated by well-intentioned individuals, perpetuate a hoax. Bonfiglio said no LSD-laced tattoos have been reported in Middle Tennessee. One letter notes the information came from a \"J. O'Donnell, Danbury Hospital Outpatient Chemical Dependency Treatment Center.\" No other details are provided. There is a chemical dependency center at Danbury Hospital in Connecticut. Apparently the volume of inquiries has been so high that the answering machine states: \"We did not issue this warning. . . . We have not had any indication of this occurring in our area.\" Even if the tattoos exist, Bonfiglio said touching them as the letters imply presents no harm. \"Kids would have to lick the tattoo to get it absorbed into the body,\" he said. The warning flyers began resurfacing early last month, said Joe Edgens, director of operations for Metro Schools. His copy came from the Metro Emergency Management office, which learned about the tattoos from the Tennessee Emergency Management Association, which was sent the information from Washington, D.C. Edgens said he forwarded the letter to school principals. Many, like Chadwell Elementary Principal Jim Bob James, copied the letter and sent it home with children. In his letter to parents, James cautions parents that \"Blue Star\" tattoos laced with LSD are being sold to children. Other tattoos resembling postage stamps with Superman, Disney characters and Bart Simpson could also be drug laced and dangerous, he added. The letter continues: \"If your child gets any of the above, do not handle them. These are known to react quickly and some are laced with strychnine.\" James said he had his students' best interest at heart when he sent out the alarming letter. \"If it is a hoax, it's still important to look out for the safety of our children. If anything, it could make parents more cautious of what their children have.\" Edgens added: \"If you err, err on the side of safety. I don't know that we've erred.\" More information about this legend can be found in Dave Gross' comprehensive Blue Star Acid FAQ.

"Barbara Mikkelson" 2000-10-11 "A little girl whose habit it was to hang her head out the school bus window was decapitated by a road sign." "This is a classic cautionary tale intended to keep youngsters from engaging in dangerous practices even when the parents aren't around to watch over them. The legend is generally circulated in one of two forms: as a horrific example of what happened to a heedless little kid riding on a school bus, or the awful fate that befell the beloved family dog allowed to ride with its head lolling out the car window. Both versions are held up as graphic examples to bolster what would otherwise be simple admonishments to kids to keep hands and feet inside vehicles at all times. <IMG WIDTH=170 HEIGHT=82 ALT=\"School bus\" SRC=\"https://www.snopes.com/uploads/images/horrors/graphics/bus.gif\" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=16 VSPACE=16 BORDER=0> As much as we hate to undermine the effects good parental scaremongering with base facts, to the best of our knowledge there has yet to be a documented case of such a death. Kids riding in school buses have died — some even after hitting their heads on objects outside the bus — but there's yet to be a decapitation as described in the legend, let alone one by a road sign. As for dogs in cars, same thing — we've yet to find an instance of one losing its head in this manner. The closest the legend has come to turning into reality have been the deaths of real teens and pre-teens who stuck their heads out school bus windows, only to smack into poles and trees once the vehicles began to move. In 2010, 11-year-old Tiffany Lynn Ross-DiCicco of Detroit died of injuries received after being struck in the head by a tree branch while waving at a friend from a school bus window. In 1996, 13-year-old Minnesota teenager Charles Johnson was leaning out a school bus window to shout to friends when the bus began to move and his head slammed against a tree. The boy died of his injuries on impact. In 1994, 13-year-old Alicia Brager of New Jersey was leaning out an open window just as the school bus pulled away from the curb at her school, and she hit her head on a utility pole. In 1988, 15-year-old Richard Bailey of New Hampshire also died of head injuries after his attempt to get a better view of a schoolyard fight from inside the bus resulted in his hitting his head on a utility pole when the vehicle pulled away from the curb. As tragic as those deaths are, they aren't the legend. Though they are clear examples of the fatal consequences of not keeping heads inside the bus and thus speak directly to the underlying reason for passing along \"The Beheaded Schoolkid\" (which is to protect the young from their own folly), such real-life events don't contain the most important element of the legend — decapitation. Why the focus on decapitation, you say? The \"beheading\" element is indispensable to the story if the tale is to serve to keep kids safe. Without the gory mental image of a tyke's head lopped off and rolling down the road while inside the bus the now headless body spurts blood everywhere, the tale's message would be in danger of being forgotten. \"Don't stick your head out a vehicle's window because you might get hurt\" just isn't going to rein in a kid the way \"A little girl had her head chopped off for doing exactly what you're doing right now\" will. To be effective as a caution that will be recalled by youngsters and acted upon, the described death has to be especially gruesome. Vivid mental imagery has to serve in place of an adult's understanding of death because kids and young people often have only a tenuous comprehension of their own mortality. Telling them they risk fatally smacking their heads into a pole lacks the requisite shock value to make such a warning memorable. But toss in a beheading and some spurting blood, and at least some of the message is likely to get through. The same principle is at work here that motivates the classic \"Don't run with a stick in your hand\" admonition: Kids are always told \"or you might fall and gouge out your eye,\" never \"or you might fall on it and hurt yourself.\" In defense of this and similar parental fictions, such grisly cautions do influence us even into adulthood. As a child, I was repeatedly warned not to hang my arm out the car window because it could get cut off. Though I've turned this one over in my head many times and come to the conclusion such a freakish accident would likely never happen, even to this day when I so much as rest a hand out in the sunshine just past that window, this ghastly warning immediately floods my mind, and I am washed with guilt for even daring to risk such a possibility.

 Domestic Terrorism Division
 Headquarters Field Office
 Washington D.C. This message is classified at Security Level 3B
File Copy Only To Be Maintained. No Duplication Permitted Operational Immediate:  Pass this information along immediately to all field agents, office staff, and support personel, special attention to notification of male staff members.  It has now been verified that a new radical splinter group has broken from the main group of the Zero Population Movement. This new group, calling itself simply \"No More!\" has started to conduct a campaign of domestic terrorism, aimed at reducing the human population of this planet.  All staff are hereby advised to use extreme caution when using any public or semi-public restroom facilities, especially male staff members.  A confirmed 172 cases of maiming have occurred, with 13 resulting in the death of the victim. Many more cases are pending confirmation.  The \"No More\" group has designed an insidious device that they have been placing in the toilets in public restrooms across the nation. 6 have been found in limited access buildings.  The devices consist of a straight razor, a springload mechanism, and a pressure senser. The devices are cleverly hidden underneath the rim of the toilet bowl, and are not visible except by close inspection from inside the space of the bowl.  When a subject weighing over 120 pounds sits on the toilet, the pressure senser connected to the toilet seat activates within 5 to 12 seconds, causing the springloaded razor to sweep across the forward half of the toilet.  This results in extreme trauma to, or complete severing from the body of the victims testicles.  In 102 cases, this has also resulted in the loss or damage of between 6 and 54% of the victims penis.  3 female victims have also suffered minor lacerations. One to the buttocks, and two to the back of the thighs.  Plans are being formulated to share this information with state and local law enforcement agencies as soon as it is feasable, without chancing widespread panic amongst the civilian population.  Information gathered by the Detroit Field Office also indicates that plans are in the works to install these devices in private residences. Members of \"No More\" plan to install the devices while in the guise of service providers, such as plumblers. There is no evidence yet to indicate that this practice has yet started.  Inform all staff soonest. Staff on their days off should be contacted at home. Every effort should be made to also contact staff on vacation, medical or disability leave, or any other leave of absence.  I cannot stress strongly enough the danger that this poses. message ends

 Origins: This bit of silliness began making the online rounds at the end of September 2000 and is another example of hoaxsters' preying upon deep-rooted fears of castration. Once again, our toilets are supposedly turning against us: 1999's deadly lurking butt spiders have been replaced with a spring-loaded slice-o-matic with a jones for johnsons. Despite the dire-sounding, badly-spelled e-mail quoted above, no such cases have been reported anywhere. This lack of reportage is tangentally alluded to as an effort to keep everything hush-hush so as not to cause a \"widespread panic amongst the civilian population.\" Rest assured the media would have broken such a story if any such attacks had come to the attention of even one reporter. It's equally ludicrous to assume the families of the thirteen men who supposedly lost their lives in this fashion would stand silently by, neither raising a public outcry to warn others, nor attempting to hold anyone accountable for the loss of their loved ones.

"Snopes Staff" 2000-09-28 "A prisoner killed himself using a deck of playing cards." "As unlikely as this must sound, playing cards have reportedly been used as an instrument of death. On 20 October 1930, William Kogut, an inmate on San Quentin's death row, fashioned ordinary decks of pasteboards into a pipe bomb, which he used to take his own life. Kogut was awaiting execution for the throat-slash murder of Mayme Guthrie, who ran a rooming house (which may have doubled as a gaming house and brothel) in Oroville, California. Kogut removed a hollow steel leg from his cot, tore several packs of playing cards into tiny pieces, and stuffed these bits into the pipe. (At the time, red playing cards were reportedly made using a rather volatile ink.) He plugged one end tightly with a broom handle, and poured water into the other end to soak the torn cards. He then placed this device on top of the kerosene heater next to his bed, laid down, and put his head up against the open end of the pipe. The heater turned the water into steam, and when the pressure built up to a high enough level, the resulting explosion shot the bits of playing cards out of the pipe with enough force to penetrate Kogut's skull. Kogut felt he should punish himself for having taken Guthrie's life rather than let the State carry out its mandate. His suicide note, addressed to the warden, read: \"Do not blame my death on any one because I fixed everything myself. I never give up as long as I am living and have a chance, but this is the end.\"" 2000 "Sep" 9 1930

"Barbara Mikkelson" 2000-09-27 "The morning after a one-night fling, a man walks into his bathroom and finds the words “WELCOME TO THE WORLD OF AIDS” scrawled on the mirror in lipstick." "Commonly known as \"AIDS Mary\" or \"AIDS Harry,\" this legend came into prominence in late 1986 and was as much an expression of the fears of that time as anything else. Though AIDS had been with us for years before that, it was only in the late 1980s that heterosexuals began to wake up to this Grim Reaper walking among them, not just their gay siblings: Example: [Collected on the Internet, 1994] A guy's friends throw him a 21st birthday party. They get him drunk and then a hotel room and a prostitute for his present. In the morning when this guy wakes up the prostitute is gone. When he goes to the bathroom, written on the mirror with lipstick is: WELCOME TO THE WORLD OF AIDS!  (A related legend has it that madmen attack the unsuspecting with AIDS-tainted needles. See our Pin Prick Attacks page for more on this related myth.) When the \"AIDS Mary\" legend began spreading, AIDS was a fearsome disease: once HIV-positive, the infected lived under a death sentence. That alone would frighten anyone, but tie this deadly disease to the usual apprehensions about sex with anyone (let alone strangers), and a cautionary urban legend results. The legend speaks to our fears; as such, it's larger than life, complete with shocking messages of impending death callously delivered. In the \"AIDS Mary\" version (woman infects man), a fellow picks up a young lady for a one-night sexual encounter. Everything goes swimmingly, and he's quite pleased about the whole thing, until the next morning when he awakens to find her gone and the words \"WELCOME TO THE WORLD OF AIDS\" scrawled in lipstick on his bathroom mirror. The \"AIDS Harry\" version (man infects woman) usually features a romance of some duration taking place in a faraway place. The depraved infector passes along his good news by way of a gift, which he asks his victim to unwrap once she's on the plane home. Depending upon where you hear this story, the gift will be a minature coffin (ceramic or wooden) or a coffee mug. Whichever item it is, it will invariably be emblazoned with the message \"WELCOME TO THE WORLD OF AIDS.\" Often given as the reason for the infector's rampage through the ranks of the previously untouched is the justification of his or her having caught the disease from a member of the opposite sex — now the entire gender will be made to pay. This cautionary tale warns against the dangers of promiscuity, but it also brings into play the fear of falling prey to a random act of violence at the hands of a madman. There have been actual cases of the HIV-infected engaging in unprotected sex without first informing their partners of their condition. In the largest documented case of its kind, Darnell \"Boss Man\" McGee infected at least 18 women and girls. McGee, 28, had more than 100 known sex partners before he was slain in 1997 in an apparent robbery attempt. In 1998, authorities in New York said 17 people are believed to have HIV infections linked to Nushawn Williams. Such tragedies are real, but the stuff of legends, the deliberate infection of another as a way of exacting revenge on an entire sex has proved elusive to pin down. Even so, there might be one real AIDS Mary to record on the pages of this legend's history. In July 1998 HIV-positive Pamela Wiser of Lewisburg, Tennessee, was picked up by police on a tip from a man she'd slept with. Under questioning, she claimed over the previous year to have had sex with more than 50 men in an effort to take revenge for three years earlier having caught the disease from her then boyfriend. She claimed to have informed each of the men of her condition prior to engaging them in sexual activity. Within a few days of her arrest, her story began to change. She revised the number of men exposed down from fifty to five. By the time her case came to trial in December, 1998, she had settled on 22 but then was asserting her motivation for sleeping with them stemmed from an inability to say no, not from any desire to cause harm. Some of Wiser's former lovers testified she hadn't informed them she was HIV-positive and that, moreover, she outright denied the need for protection when directly asked. One of them has since tested positive for the disease. In February, 1999, Wiser was sentenced to 26-1/2 years in prison. Was the motivation revenge, an inability to say no, or something altogether different? Without cracking open her head and looking in, it's impossible to tell. Whichever way one calls the Wiser episode, it should be noted no lipsticked mirrors or teeny ceramic coffins played any part in the story. The key difference between legend and real life goes to motivation. The real-life bad guys who don't give their partners a choice by informing them of the risks ahead of time are driven by denial (I'm not really sick; I'm not going to die), indifference (nobody looked out for me), or fear of loss of affection (she won't want me once she finds out about this), whereas the storybook ones are out to exact revenge for the wrong done them. It's the difference between a fiendish rifle-wielding madman cold-bloodedly picking off random freeway drivers, and a self-pitying fool carelessly weaving in and out of traffic, oblivious to the carnage he's causing around him — one is murdering with malice aforethought, and the other is indifferent to harm he might or might not be causing. Speaking to the second variety, the 1992 the case of Roy Cornes captured worldwide attention. Dubbed the \"AIDS Timebomb,\" he was accused of knowingly infecting at least four women (one of whom has since died, as has he). He maintained harming others was not his intent, his partners knew of his condition (a claim some of them disputed), and that in a couple of early cases he passed along the virus because he didn't yet understand what precautions to take, while in a later case, he and his fiancee were trying for a baby and she took the risks willingly. We're tempted to dismiss his claims of how all this infecting came about, but then we're left scrambling for a reasonable explanation for his actions. Revenge on all women for one particular woman having given him the virus couldn't have been his motive, because he contracted HIV from blood tranfusions. (He was a hemophiliac). Depraved indifference, then? Hardest of all to classify are the motivations of Gaetan Dugas, AIDS \"Patient Zero.\" In 1980 this charming and handsome Canadian airline attendant was diagnosed with Kaposi's sarcoma (a type of skin cancer). Until his death in 1984, he continued to engage in episodes of unprotected sex with a variety of partners. These were the early days of AIDS (which incidentally didn't get its name until 1982), and what was going on, let alone how it was being transmitted, wasn't at all clear. Back then there was no strong central authority braying out messages that unprotected sex could kill or even that AIDS was communicated through sexual contact. In the absence of that, those with a mind to could well ignore what was slowly surfacing in the press or dismiss it as so much hooey. Dugas appeared to move between denial that whatever he had could be transmitted sexually (\"Of course I'm going to have sex. Nobody's proven to me that you can spread cancer\"), depraved indifference to his partners' wellbeing (\"It's their duty to protect themselves. They know what's going on out there. They've heard about this disease\"), and a desire to take others with him (\"I've got gay cancer. I'm going to die and so are you\"). Possibly his rationale came down to something much simpler — he loved sex, if not his partners. Living under a death sentence, perhaps he was determined to enjoy his last moments on earth, and consequences be damned. The spectre of the vengeful AIDS carrier looms far larger than the real cases of those whose indifference led them to infect others. In 1995 an Irish priest shocked his congregation with the tale of an HIV-positive woman who had slept with up to 80 young men across four southern Irish counties in a deliberate attempt to infect as many as possible with the deadly AIDS virus. The priest said he had personally traced about 25 of the men, and that five had tested positive for HIV. Scary stuff indeed, and who would doubt the word of a priest? Months went by, and although parishioners continued to take the roman-collared vector's word as gospel, health officials could find nothing to substantiate the priest's claims. Indeed, speaking to his credibility, a follow-up article about this man made mention of another improbable tale he was now spreading: Six months later, he is still the local hero. The latest story about Father Michael Kennedy, curate of Dungarvan, Co Waterford, is that he saved a woman's life recently. Apparently, he made a late night house call to an elderly woman. There was no reply at the door and he called the gardai. They broke in and found her collapsed on the floor with hypothermia. It did not make the papers but most people in town have heard about it. The gardai in Dungarvan have no record of it, but that does not mean it did not happen, they say. In other words, this is one yarn spinner of a holy man. At least one criminal tried to use the gist of the 'AIDS Mary' legend as part of his legal defense. In his trial for the 1990 murder of Linda Hoberg, Jeffrey Hengehold claimed he'd met the victim in a bar and had sex with her later that night; as they were parting, she said, \"Welcome to the world of AIDS.\" He then proceeded to beat her to death. Though Hengehold claimed this was his motive for the murder, there was no evidence to prove it one way or the other. Hengehold had cremated Hoberg's body, making it impossible to determine if she'd had AIDS, and he himself never tested positive for HIV. The laws of most countries are inadequate when it comes to assessing and penalizing the crime of knowingly transmitting a deadly disease, but at least one of them is moving in the right direction. Britain is even now trying to reform laws to cover this form of assault. Changes are in the works that would result in an HIV-infected person who tried to pass on the virus out of malice being charged with grievous bodily harm with intent, and those who simply failed to take proper precautions charged under the lesser offence of causing grievous bodily harm. Sightings: Scary legends also make great movie plots, so it should come as no surprise this legend showed up as the plot of the 1992 German movie Via Appia. (An airline steward has a one-night fling. He wakes the next morning to find his partner gone and \"Welcome to the AIDS Club\" written in soap on his mirror.) The plot of an HIV-positive man deliberately trying to infect as many women as possible was also used for an episode of TV's Law & Order (\"Carrier\", originally broadcast 1 April 1998).6 October 2006 27 September 2000 - original 6 October 2006 - reformatted \"Also told in the big book of urban legends\"" 2000 "Sep" 9 1980

"David Mikkelson" 2000-09-26 "A good Samaritan warns a female driver about the armed and dangerous man hiding in the back seat of her car." "Stories about a stranger slipping into the back seat of a solo woman's car, presumably with ill intentions, have been circulating in various forms both on and off the Internet for many years: A friend stopped at a pay-at-the-pump gas station to get gas. Once she filled her gas tank and after paying at the pump and starting to leave, the voice of the attendant inside came over the speaker.. He told her that something happened with her card and that she needed to come inside to pay. The lady was confused because the transaction showed complete and approved. She relayed that to him and was getting ready to leave but the attendant, once again, urged her to come in to pay or there'd be trouble. She proceeded to go inside and started arguing with the attendant about his threat. He told her to calm down and listen carefully: He said that while she was pumping gas, a guy slipped into the back seat of her car on the other side and the attendant had already called the police.She became frightened and looked out in time to see her car door open and the guy slip out. The report is that the new gang initiation thing is to bring back a woman and/or her car. One way they are doing this is crawling under women's cars while they're pumping gas or at grocery stores in the nighttime. The other way is slipping into unattended cars and kidnapping the women.Please pass this on to other women, young and old alike. Be extra careful going to and from your car at night. If at all possible, don't go alone! This is real!! The message: 1. ALWAYS lock your car doors, even if you're gone for just a second! 2. Check underneath your car when approaching it for reentry, and check in the back before getting in. 3. Always be aware of your surroundings and of other individuals in your general vicinity, particularly at night! Send this to everyone so your friends can take precaution. AND GUYS...YOU TELL ANY WOMEN YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS Thanks, Barbara Baker, Secretary Directorate of Training U.S. Army Military Police School <!--
[Collected on the Internet, 1998] It was a dark and foggy night. Denise was having trouble staying awake and the road was slick. Her anxiety level was not helped by the fact that she was running low on gas and didn't know where the next town was. Finally, just as she thought she would have to pull over and sleep till morning on the side of the road, a tiny gas station appeared — very rundown, but a gas station nonetheless. She pulled in. The attendant made his way around the car and seemed to be very distracted as she asked him to fill it up, and even seemed to be making faces at her. He finally agreed to get the gas, but then asked her to pop the hood of the car because it \"smelled like trouble.\" Her anxiety from being on the road was starting to flare up again, she was all alone in a creepy gas station out in the middle of nowhere and an attendant was finding reasons to keep her there. He asked her to come look at the engine, he had to \"show her something\". Not knowing what else to do, almost as if in a daze, she did as he asked, all the while wondering why she didn't scream. As she rounded the front of the car he grabbed her arm and said, \"This car needs a tow, you'll have to come with me into the office.\" Then he put his hand over her mouth and forced her into the office. She began to bite his hand once they were inside and he let her go and said, \"I'm sorry, but there is a man crouched down in the backseat of your car and I didn't want him to know that I'd seen him.\" They called the police who came to arrest the serial killer who, unbeknownst to Denise, had stowed away in her car and was waiting for the opportune moment to add her to his list of victims. Denise and the gas attendant now own the station and their three kids help them with the chores. Isn't that sweet?
 [Brunvand, 1981] A woman living in the city [Salt Lake] was visiting some friends in Ogden. When she got into her car in front of this friend's house, she noticed that a car started up right behind her car. It was about 2:00 in the morning, and there weren't any other cars on the road. After she had driven to the highway, she began to think that this car was following her. Some of the time he would drive up real close to her car, but he wouldn't ever pass. She was really scared to death and kept speeding to try to get away from him. When she got to Salt Lake, she started running stop lights to get away from him, but he would run right through them too. So when she got to her driveway she pulled in really fast, and this guy pulled in right behind her. She just laid on the horn, and her husband came running out. Just then, the guy jumped out of the car, and her husband ran over and said, \"What the hell's goin' on here?\" So he grabbed the guy, and his wife said, \"This man's followed me all the way from Ogden.\" The man said, \"I followed your wife because I was going to work, and as I got into my car, I noticed when I turned my lights on, a man's head bob down in her back seat.\" So the husband went over to her backseat, opened the door, and pulled this guy from out of the backseat.
 [Collected on the Internet, 1999] I am passing this along because I know of a incident similar to this. My girlfriend was getting some gas and when she attempted to return to her car the gas station attendant starting yelling at her and telling her she did not pay yet. When she went back in to argue about having already paid the attendant told her he just wanted to get her back in because he saw someone crawl in the backseat of her car, and that he had already called the police. So it's worth taking to heart. This is a true story. it has been \"ritual\" of gang members to take one body part from women as an initiation into gangs. the rule is that it has to be in a well lit area and at a gas station, so be careful. they tend to lay under the car, and slash females' ankles when she goes to get in her car, causing her to fall and then they cut off a body part and roll and run. they are known to hide behind the gas pumps too, so be careful. It might sound bizarre and gross, but the bigger the body part the higher the initiation they receive. This was commmunicated by a person who works in law enforcement in the south. She has investigated and been called to a number of these scenes. She has also confirmed the following statement below as true and not an internet \"hoax.\" Please pass these on to as many people you know... mothers, sisters, grandparents, daughters, nieces and friends. It seems the world has become a crazy place to live in, but let's be careful out there and make stuff like this known so we are better protected.
 [Collected on the Internet, 2000] A FRIEND OF MINE SENT THIS TO ME AND ASK THAT IT BE PASSED ALONG. BE AWARE OF YOUR CIRCUMSTANCES AT ALL TIMES . . . THIS IS A TRUE STORY. This actually happened to my friend's niece last week right here near downtown. It was after dark and she stopped to get gas at a Quik Trip. She filled her tank and walked into the store to pay for her gas. The cashier told her \"don't pay for your gas yet . . . walk around the store a while and act as if you're picking up some other things to buy. A man just got into the back of your car. I've called the police and they're on their way.\" When the police arrived, they found the man in the back seat of the girl's car and asked him what he was doing. He replied, he was joining a gang and the initiation to join is to kidnap a woman and bring her back to the gang to be raped. According to the police that night, there is a new gang forming here originating from Chicago. Part of the scary part of this is because the guy didn't have a weapon on him the police could only charge him with trespassing ... he's back on the streets and free to try again. Please be aware of what's going on around you, ladies. This could happen to any one. Please forward this on to anyone you care about!
 [Collected on the Internet, 2001] THIS IS TOO SERIOUS.....DO NOT DELETE. PLEASE PASS IT ON!! A friend stopped at a pay-at-the-pump gas station to get gas. Once she filled her gas tank and after paying at the pump and starting to leave, the voice of the attendant inside came over the speaker. He told her that something happened with her card and that she needed to come inside to pay. The lady was confused because the transaction showed complete and approved. She relayed that to him and was getting ready to leave but the attendant, once again, urged her to come in to pay or there'd be trouble. She proceeded to go inside and started arguing with the attendant about his threat. He told her to calm down and listen carefully: He said that while she was pumping gas, a guy slipped into the back seat of her car on the other side and the attendant had already called the police. She became frightened and looked out in time to see her car door open and the guy slip out. The report is that the new gang initiation thing is to bring back a woman's body part. One way they are doing this is crawling under girls/women's cars while they're pumping gas or at grocery stores in the night time. Then they are cutting the lady's ankles to disable them in order to kidnap them, kill, and dismember them. The other way is slipping into unattended cars and kidnapping the women to kill and dismember them. Please pass this on to other women, young and old alike. Be extra careful going to and from your car at night. If at all possible, don't go alone! This is real!! The message:
1. ALWAYS lock your car doors, even if you're gone for just a second. 2. Check underneath your car when approaching it for reentry, and check in the back before getting in. 3. Always be aware of your surroundings and of other individuals in your general vicinity, particularly at night! Send this to everyone so your friend will not be the next one. AND GUYS...YOU TELL ANY WOMEN YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS Barbara Baker, Secretary Directorate of Training U.S. Army Military Police School
 [Collected on the Internet, 2004] The Dublin criminal gang - The Westies are having an initiation ceremony at the moment for new members. It's aimed at women driving alone. They hang around garages and when a woman alone goes into the garage to pay for her petrol, a guy gets into the car and hides in the back seat. When the woman gets into her car the guy holds her at knifepoint and takes her to be gang-raped. This is a serious message that came to me by my Father. He was talking to his friend who is a Detective in Garda H.Q in Harcourt Street. The Detective told Dad to pass this on to women. One incident has happened in Dublin but luckily the woman got away. The petrol attendant saw a guy getting into her car and hiding in the back seat. He called her back pretending there was a problem with her credit card. They called the police and they took the guy to Blanch station to be questioned. Please, please pass this on and be careful. LOCK YOUR CAR when you are paying for petrol and just be careful.
 [Collected via e-mail, October 2008] Hess Gas Station on Timberlake Rd To those of you who are AREVA employees - you may have already heard this but I have some more information to pass along. Some time over the weekend, an AREVA employee's (Kent Hancock) daughter and a friend of hers (both in separate cars), stopped at a Hess Gas Station on Timberlake Rd to get gas. One pulled up on one side of the pumps and the other pulled up on the other side and when they were finished, they walked into the store together to pay. When they went inside, the male cashier asked the friend if she was aware that a guy had gotten into the back seat of her car. The 2 of them looked outside and said no that they were not with anyone else and riding alone. They called the Police and within 2 - 3 minutes they showed up, found the guy in the back seat with a gun and arrested him. When they interrogated him, he admitted that it was part of a gang initiation to rape and kill a white girl to get into the gang. Thank goodness the cashier was paying attention! Most of you have seen emails before about stories like this. I've never heard of it actually happening in Lynchburg. This a true story. Last I heard, Kent's son James (also an employee) is supposed to make a Near Miss out of it to send to all employees. Please tell everyone you know to lock their car while they are pumping gas - even if they are paying at the pump and standing beside the car. I don't know which Hess gas station it was and I also don't know what time of day it happened. Just please be careful and tell everyone you know that lives in this area to also be careful and aware of their
surroundings.
 [Collected via e-mail, August 2013] An important message from the Police - please pass this along to all the women you know..... This actually happened a few weeks ago on the M3 FLEET SERVICES!!! It was early evening, and a young girl stopped to get petrol. She filled her tank and walked into the store to pay for her petrol.. The cashier told her, 'Don't pay for your petrol yet... walk around the store for a while, and act as if you're picking up some other things to buy. A man just got into the back of your car. I've called the police, and they're on their way'. When the police arrived, they found the man in the back seat of the girl's car and asked him what he was doing. He replied, he was joining a gang, and the initiation to join is to kidnap a woman and bring her back to the gang to be raped by every member of the gang. If the woman was still alive by the time they finish with her then they let her go. According to the police that night, there is a new gang forming here, originating from London . The scary part of this is, because the guy didn't have a weapon on him, the police could only charge him with trespassing.... He's back on the street and free to try again. Something similar to this happened at the Tesco garage on Cardiff Road in Newport recently, but luckily the cashier saw the man get into her car. Please be aware of what's going on around you, and warn your family and friends. LADIES, you or one of your family or friends could be the next victim. Please forward this on to everyone you know. Please do not discard this message; it is very important that everyone knows what is happening. Please be careful when leaving your vehicle, and make sure it is ALWAYS LOCKED to prevent this from happening to you.

Variations:  Despite the legend's many incarnations and long history, there's little or no record of its ever playing out in real life. It's merely a cautionary tale warning us to be vigilant of our surroundings — there just aren't that many bad guys lurking in backseats to get worried about. Though there have been rapes wherein the attacker hid in the back seat of an automobile, they are rather rare occurrences (one example of which took place in the Chicago area in March 2013). As for carjackings, in the overwhelming majority of them the assailant opens the door and gets into the car while the driver is behind the wheel; there's little of this \"lurking in the backseat\" bit. The legend, unlike many, might originally have been prompted by a real news story: Research shows that one true case of \"The Killer in the Backseat\" did occur in 1964 in New York City, when an escaped murderer hid in the backseat of a car. The car, ironically, belonged to a police detective who shot the man. Though the differences between the legend and the true occurrence are vast (the real occurrence did not feature a lone female; it didn't necessarily happen at night; and no third person was involved), the legend may have sprung out of this real incident: Even as a horror legend, this one is sexist to the core. As mentioned earlier, the prey is always female and both the evil fiend and the rescuer are male — there are no exceptions to this typecasting (even though men are far more often the victims of killing by strangers than women are). Both male figures are seen as powerful: the fiend for his evilness and mad intent, the rescuer for his coolness in knowing what to do and his ease in dispatching the fiend: The warnings that the woman misunderstood as aggression lead to a surprising turn of events: her fear was misdirected and the danger came from somewhere much closer than she realized, the backseat of her own car! The woman, by contrast, is portrayed as completely and irredeemably ineffective. In none of the tellings does she catch on to the source of her peril; she always needs a man to set the record straight. (The task of rescuing her from a dangerous situation also falls to a guy; the woman is never involved in either containing the bad guy until the police arrive or in tussling with him if he tries to escape.) Her inability to take care of herself is further driven home by her resolutely acting on the assumption that the man either chasing after her or trying to lure her into the gas station means her harm. Unaided, she can't tell friend from foe. In those recountings where anyone's ethnicity is mentioned, the man hiding in the car or the rescuer is invariably black. It's easy to see those versions as a racist reaction to anxiety about being attacked by a member of a feared group: the lurking black man represents the perceived menace of his race, waiting for the proper moment when a back is turned to strike; the rescuer's attempt to warn the victim is ignored because his color marks him as more likely to be an attacker than a protector. Update: In late 1999 through early 2002, versions circulating on the Internet which involved prospective gang members looking to kidnap a woman for rape reappeared with surprising frequency. These morphing e-mails contained specific city names (such as Chicago or Boston) and names of local chains of gas stations/convenience stores (such as \"Quik Trip,\" \"Quick Trip,\" \"Quick Stop,\" \"Kwik Trip,\" \"Kwikfill,\" and \"Citgo\"). Later versions incorporated the ankle slasher motif from another horror legend and posited that the gang initation required prospective members to bring in dismembered body parts from female victims. <!--
In September 2003, Cpl. Daniel Brub, an Interpol agent at RCMP headquarters in Ottawa, added his imprimatur to the tale when a well-traveled e-mail (gang members after body parts abducting women at gas stations) picked up his official signature. Many understood it to be an official alert from someone speaking on behalf of law enforcement. Versions soon after began circulating titled, \"Warning for Ottawa women from RCMP Criminal Operations, Interpol Ottawa.\" Yet Cpl. Brub wasn't speaking for Interpol or the RCMP, nor was he confirming incidents in the Ottawa area (there haven't been any). The sum total of his involvement amounted to passing the story to colleagues to ask what they knew about it. How his e-mail escaped into the wild remains a mystery. Barbara \"backseat diver\" Mikkelson --> Sightings: This legend shows up in the 1983 film Nightmares, the 1984 film Mr. Wrong and the 1998 film Urban Legend. You'll also spot the \"gas station\" version worked into the plot of an episode of TV's Homicide (\"Thrill of the Kill\"; originally aired 10 November 1995) and Millennium (\"The Pest House,\" original air date 27 February 1998). It was also made into a short film titled Suspicious in 1995." 2000 "Sep" 9 1960

There is some truth here, but the warning is outdated. John Edward Robinson Sr., 56, was arrested on 2 June 2000 and charged with sexual assault on two women in the Kansas City area. Robinson lured the women (as he had others) into participating in sadomasochistic sex by contacting them over the Internet under the name \"slavemaster.\" The two women filed charges after Robinson \"brutalized them in a way that went beyond what they intended.\" After Robinson's arrest, law enforcement authorities discovered two 55-gallon industrial barrels, each containing a woman's body, on land Robinson owned in Kansas. A few days later, they discovered three more bodies in barrels kept in a storage space Robinson rented in Missouri. All five women appeared to have been bludgeoned to death. Robinson was also suspected in the mid-1980s disappearances of three women and an infant whose bodies had not yet been located. One of the bodies Robinson had stored in barrels was later identified as being one of these women, and the missing infant was discovered to have been adopted by Robinson's brother. In October 2002, John Robinson was convicted of the murder of three women, the two found in the barrels on his land, and the third disappeared mother of the child he placed with his brother. In January 2003 he was sentenced to death for these murders. He has also been charged in the deaths of the three women found in Missouri. The \"slavemaster\" is monstrously real, but so far he's well short of the 56 victims claimed for him, and he remains behind bars, not out trolling the Internet for additional victims. This internet warning has taken on a life of its own, one quite independent of the facts. The small grain of truth (someone using the screen name \"Slavemaster\" has been arrested for the murders of women he contacted on the Internet) had almost been lost in the sandstorm of claims that he's out there now looking for more victims and that he's killed 56 so far. As well, pranksters have been pulling off jokes by substituting their acquaintances' screen names in place of \"Slavemaster,\" so now versions are circulating that warn netizens to be on the lookout for someone using the handle \"Dodgecity53_,\" \"SweetCaliGuy4evr,\" \"ooosparklesooo88,\" \"DreamWeaverGrey,\" \"Monkeyman935,\" \"Free_mumia911,\"\"ineedatipdrill,\" \"RatBonesBlakStar,\" \"Silly Black Goose,\" \"Buc Vet,\" \"Rooster,\" \"spikey_mikey913,\" or \"Darksideishere1,\" all screen names that have nothing to do with the real John Edward Robinson.

John Edward Robinson Sr., 56, was arrested on 2 June 2000 and charged with sexual assault on two women in the Kansas City area. Robinson lured the women (as he had others) into participating in sadomasochistic sex by contacting them over the Internet under the name \"slavemaster.\" The two women filed charges after Robinson \"brutalized them in a way that went beyond what they intended.\" After Robinson's arrest, law enforcement authorities discovered two 55-gallon industrial barrels, each containing a woman's body, on land Robinson owned in Kansas. A few days later, they discovered three more bodies in barrels kept in a storage space Robinson rented in Missouri. All five women appeared to have been bludgeoned to death. Robinson was also suspected in the mid-1980s disappearances of three women and an infant whose bodies had not yet been located. One of the bodies Robinson had stored in barrels was later identified as being one of these women, and the missing infant was discovered to have been adopted by Robinson's brother. In October 2002, John Robinson was convicted of the murder of three women, the two found in the barrels on his land, and the third the disappeared mother of the child he placed with his brother. In January 2003 he was sentenced to death for these murders. He has also been charged in the deaths of the three women found in Missouri. The \"slavemaster\" is monstrously real, but so far he's well short of the 56 victims claimed for him, and he remains behind bars, not out trolling the Internet for additional victims. This internet warning took on a life of its own, one quite independent of the facts. The small grain of truth (someone using the screen name \"Slavemaster\" was arrested for the murders of women he contacted on the Internet) was lost amidst the sandstorm of claims that he was still out there looking for more victims, and that he had killed 56 women so far. As well, pranksters have been pulling off jokes by substituting their acquaintances' screen names in place of \"Slavemaster,\" so now versions are circulating that warn netizens to be on the lookout for someone using the handle \"Dodgecity53_,\" \"SweetCaliGuy4evr,\" \"ooosparklesooo88,\" \"DreamWeaverGrey,\" \"Monkeyman935,\" \"Free_mumia911,\"\"ineedatipdrill,\" \"RatBonesBlakStar,\" \"Silly Black Goose,\" \"Buc Vet,\" \"Rooster,\" \"spikey_mikey913,\" or \"Darksideishere1,\" all screen names that have nothing to do with the real John Edward Robinson. <FONT COLOR=\"\" class=\"copyright_text_color_g\" FACE=\"\" class=\"sect_font_style\"><B>Additional information:</B></FONT> <TABLE CELLSPACING=16 BORDER=0> <TR><TD> &nbsp; &nbsp; <a HREF=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20080617131455/https://archives.cnn.com/2000/US/06/07/barrel.bodies/index.html\" onMouseOver=\"window.status='Evidence sought in Kansas-Missouri barrel deaths';return true\" onMouseOut=\"window.status='';return true\" TARGET=cnn1><IMG WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=40 ALT=\"Evidence sought in Kansas-Missouri barrel deaths\" SRC=\"https://www.snopes.com/content/themes/snopes/assets/images/common/page.gif\" ALIGN=ABSMIDDLE BORDER=0></A></TD> <TD><FONT COLOR=#FF0000 FACE=\"\" class=\"main_font_style\" SIZE=3> &nbsp; Evidence Sought in Kansas-Missouri Barrel Deaths &nbsp; (<I>CNN.com<I>)</FONT></TD></TR> <TR><TD> &nbsp; &nbsp; <a HREF=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20080313164305/https://archives.cnn.com/2000/US/06/08/barrel.bodies/index.html\" onMouseOver=\"window.status='More clues sought in barrel deaths';return true\" onMouseOut=\"window.status='';return true\" TARGET=cnn2><IMG WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=40 ALT=\"More clues sought in barrel deaths\" SRC=\"https://www.snopes.com/content/themes/snopes/assets/images/common/page.gif\" ALIGN=ABSMIDDLE BORDER=0></A></TD> <TD><FONT COLOR=#FF0000 FACE=\"\" class=\"main_font_style\" SIZE=3> &nbsp; More Clues Sought in Barrel Deaths &nbsp; (<I>CNN.com<I>)</FONT></TD></TR> <TR><TD> &nbsp; &nbsp; <a HREF=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20080224153140/https://archives.cnn.com/2000/US/06/12/barrel.bodies.01/index.html\" onMouseOver=\"window.status='Barrel killings probe expands to Florida';return true\" onMouseOut=\"window.status='';return true\" TARGET=cnn3><IMG WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=40 ALT=\"Barrel killings probe expands to Florida\" SRC=\"https://www.snopes.com/content/themes/snopes/assets/images/common/page.gif\" ALIGN=ABSMIDDLE BORDER=0></A></TD> <TD><FONT COLOR=#FF0000 FACE=\"\" class=\"main_font_style\" SIZE=3> &nbsp; Barrel Killings Probe Expands to Florida &nbsp; (<I>CNN.com<I>)</FONT></TD></TR> </TABLE>" 2000 "Sep" 9 2000

"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/arent-you-glad-you-didnt-turn-on-the-light/" "legend" "A college student makes a horrifying discovery." "David Mikkelson" 2000-09-08 "A female college student returns to her dorm room late one evening and discovers her roommate has been murdered." "Of all the horror legends we were asked about in 1997, this was far and away the most frequent one to show up in the snopes.com e-mailbox. Unlike just about every other \"classic\" horror legend (e.g. The Hook and The Boyfriend's Death), this one is even now being both told and believed on college campuses. Examples: [Collected on the Internet, 1997] Supposedly, at another college in the state, a girl was studying late and went back to her dorm room to get some books or notes. So she wouldn’t disturb her roommate, she didn’t turn on the lights when she got her stuff off of her desk. Later when she went back to her room, she found her roommate dead and a note written in lipstick on the mirror. It said, \"Aren’t you glad you didn’t turn on the light?\"
 A young lady is alone in her apartment. She goes to bed with her dog on the floor beside her. In the middle of the night, she is woken up by a strange sound. She is alarmed, but reaches down to the dog, who licks her hand. She is reassured and goes back to sleep. In the morning, she finds the dog hung in the shower. Where the dog slept, she picks up a note which reads \"Humans can lick too.\" <img src=\"https://www.snopes.com/uploads/images/horrors/graphics/lighton.jpg\" alt=\"Cartoon of the legend\" width=\"202\" height=\"277\" align=\"RIGHT\" border=\"1\" hspace=\"16\" vspace=\"16\" /> Details vary wildly from version to version — sometimes the survivor comes looking for a sweater instead of her books, or she's been at a party instead of the library, or she stops by briefly to check on her sick roommate (leaving immediately because she assumes the girl is sleeping). In some versions she returns home to find the police in the process of investigating the murder, and sometimes she's the one who discovers the body, having awakened the next morning to find both the slashed-throat corpse and the note. Depending on who is telling the story, either the girlfriend, or the dog, or both the girlfriend and the dog are found with their throats cut. (In the \"humans can lick too\" versions, the dog is often discovered hanging in the bathroom, the blood from its slashed throat dripping onto the tiles, this dripping sound being the odd noise that wakes the girl who lived through the night.) The \"Aren't you glad . . .\" and the \"Humans can lick too\" versions are so closely related that it is difficult to think of them as separate legends. Once the details are boiled away, the same basic storyline is revealed in both — a young woman is oblivious to a grisly killing taking place in front of her, and just how close the call was is revealed in the chilling comment left by the murderer. Be it dog or roommate which ends up on the slab, the real horror of the moment is focused on the girl who survives. (Murder victims are a dime a dozen — what makes the blood run cold is the thought of the one who just barely got away.) Proving that even modern legends can have much older roots, the \"licked hand\" motif shows up in an 11 August 1871 diary entry penned in England by one Dearman Birchall: Croquet party . . . [One of the guests] told of a clergyman who was aroused in the middle of the night by his wife who said 'John, dear, I am sure there is a robber under the bed, I hear him moving. Do get up and see.' John replied, 'Oh its only the Newfoundland dog. I just put my hand out and he licked it'. Next morning all the jewellery and many other effects had disappeared.\" Though in this 19-century version the grisly murder is missing, once again the lurking miscreant escapes detection by pretending to be the dog by licking the suspicious party's hand and thus providing reassurement that all is well. This legend is a hair-raising cautionary tale about the dangers of living away from home, and it plays upon our fears of the murdering madman turning up in our bedrooms one night. We fear becoming the victims of random violence, and we fear being vulnerable in an unsafe world. The more unsafe we perceive the world around us to be, the more tales like this get told. Sightings:
Look for this tale in 1998's Urban Legend. <span class=\"copyright_text_color\"><b>Last updated:</b></span> &nbsp; 11 October 2006

"Barbara Mikkelson" 2000-08-28 "A gang lures a little boy into a washroom and chops off his penis." "Claim: A gang lures a little boy into a washroom and chops off his penis. LEGEND Examples:  Out shopping one day with his mother in a neighbourhood shopping precinct, a boy of about ten years old went off to the public toilet. When he did not come back, his mother began to get rather worried. Seeing a policeman passing by, she explained what had happened and the officer went over to the toilet block to look for the boy. He found him almost immediately lying in a pool of blood in one of the cubicles with a crowd around him. He was still alive but was in a highly critical condition. According to an eye witness, the poor boy had been castrated by an ethnic gang of local youths.
 
 [Brunvand, 1984] I heard a story, I believe about ten years ago, it would be about 1965 — I was eighteen then — about a little white boy who had gone shopping with his mother in K mart, and he had to urinate. So, for the first time the mother decided to let him go in by himself to use the men's washroom, rather than going into the womens with her. He was in there an exceptionally long amount of time, and she got worried and asked some gentlemen to step in and see what the problem was, if there was a problem. And they found the little boy laying in a pool of blood with his penis cut off. Subsequently they found three little black boys walking through the store with a bloody penis in their pocket. As it turned out, they had cut the little white boy's penis off as an orientation, a method of getting into a gang that they wanted to belong to.
 Variations:
   Medieval European versions had Jews torturing and killing a Christian child, with this form of the legend reaching back as early as the fifth century A.D. Versions dating from the second and third centuries A.D. reversed the barbarity, with Jewish children being murdered by marauding Christians as part of their gruesome initiation rituals.    mid-1960s. Without a doubt, the central idea underlying all versions of the restroom legends is a racist or otherwise prejudiced one: certain \"other\" people — members of a feared minority — are out to get \"our\" children. \"Blood simple\" legends about feared minorities torturing and murdering helpless tots as part of their religious rituals have shifted from one group to another as the balance of who was in the minority and who was in the majority changed over time. Medieval lore is rife with tales about Jews using Christian children in their presumed diabolical rites, and lore older than that reversed matters with Christians doing like things to Jewish children they'd spirited away. In each case, the feared minority was portrayed as child torturers and murderers, folks it was thus only reasonable to hate. As folklorist Jan Brunvand has noted about racist legends: \"As we observe many times in folklore, the prejudices and stereotypes that people are reluctant to voice in direct terms will often surface in very obvious ways in their oral-narrative traditions of joke or legend.\" Key to the modern version of this ancient legend is the emasculation of a representative of one group by members of another. Fear of those who are seen to menace established society is expressed in graphic manner in this horrifying tale, with the fearful represented in the form of an innocent, helpless, angelic (and often blonde) child, and the feared portrayed as a powerful gang of mindlessly violent thugs. The set-upon child hasn't a chance against his attackers because they are many to his one, and they are also stronger and filled with hate. The person relating this legend as his way of sharing his growing anxiety at finding himself forced to co-exist with members of a minority that frightens him feels a similar sense of being outnumbered and threatened. He sees the empowerment of certain minorities or their encroachment into territory previously held to belong solely to his group as taking something vital from his power, hence the castration theme. Although this legend has traveled across the United States and England, and is always told as a \"this really happened!\" tale, all efforts to substantiate it have failed. Not so much as one instance of a boy being castrated in a washroom and left to die by a gang of folks of a different color or persuasion have surfaced although the rumor has run rampant through a number of communities, prompting various debunkers and police departments to expend great efforts to run it down. It's a legend, and nothing more. This \"mutilated boy\" legend shares commonalities with another common urban belief tale, the child kidnapped in an amusement park or store whose appearance is altered in the washroom to facilitate smuggling him out of that venue. That tale too is merely legend, but it is also widely believed. On those true life occasions when a child was picked at random and murdered in a washroom (which has happened), it was invariably the work of a monster acting on his own, not the handiwork of a gang out to terrorize another group or to expend a child from another culture in a sick initiation rite. Lore and real life part ways at this point, though actual cases involving murdered youngsters and restrooms are often mistakenly pointed to as proving the legend. Two cases from the 1990s of children murdered in washrooms stick in the mind. In May 1997, 19-year-old Jeremy Strohmeyer raped and strangled 7-year-old Sherrice Iverson in a bathroom at the Primadonna, a casino at the Nevada-California border. In September 1998, Strohmeyer was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. This case caught the attention of a nation because at the time of the murder (approximately 4 am) Sherrice had been left unsupervised while her father gambled. At 1:33 am, hotel security officers noticed the little girl was unattended and paged for someone to collect her. Her 14-year-old brother claimed her, but soon left her alone again, according to casino officials, and she played in the arcade alone for the next two hours. She was last seen alive at 3:45 am when a security camera recorded her entering the washroom where she would be killed. Meanwhile, her father occupied himself with slot machines in the casino upstairs. In November 1998, 20-year-old Brandon Wilson slit 9-year-old Matthew Cecchi's throat in an Oceanside Harbor, California, restroom. He testified that he stalked and murdered the boy because God told him to begin a killing rampage. Wilson was sentenced to death in November 1999. Horrific as these real stories are, in neither of these cases was a gang involved, nor were these murders racially motivated. Perhaps it's best remembered that though sometimes butchers rage among us, killing random victims for racial reasons, far more often they kill for no reason at all.

"Barbara Mikkelson" 2000-08-01 "A motorist who has a run-in with ruffians afterwards finds the severed fingers of his assailants caught on his car." "Claim: A motorist who has a run-in with ruffians afterwards finds the severed fingers of his assailants caught on his car.  Examples:  My brother Alan tells me about a young man who owned a Volkswagen \"beetle\" car, who took his girl friend to a drive-in movie. During the performance four young men in a old Falcon next to them, who were drinking heavily, were using shocking language loudly while discussing the story line of the picture. The young man remonstrated with them, at their use of bad language in the presence of his lady friend, to be met with torrents of abuse. When the show was over, these louts all got out of their car and advanced on him. He hastily wound up the windows of his car, started the engine, and locked the doors. He was about to drive off, when three of the young men lifted the back of his car into the air, thereby robbing the wheels of traction, while the fourth tried to force the door open. The young man panicked, engaged low gear, and revved the motor. Eventually the weight of the car proved too much, it was dropped to the ground, and the spinning wheels carried it off with a tremendous jerk, leaving the larrikins behind. When the young man got home he found three bloody fingers jammed behind the rear bumper.
 
 [Smith, 1983] A driver approaching the motorway slip road around dusks sees, ahead of him in the half light, two hitch-hikers. As it is raining he decides to stop and pick them up. However, when he gets closer and has slowed down he changes his mind for they are two very large and ill-dressed men and he does not like the look of them. As he accelerates to drive away, one of the men lashes out at the car with a large chain he has hidden. Terrified, and not at this point caring about any damage to the car, the driver speeds away down the motorway as fast as he can go. It is only when he stops at a service station that he has an opportunity to inspect the car for damage and, to his surprise, he discovers the assailant's chain wrapped around the rear bumper. When he comes to remove the offensive weapon, to his horror, he finds, tightly fastened in a knot in the other end of the chain, two fingers torn from the hand of the hitch-hiker.
 Variations:     Origins: This legend about the escaped motorist who only afterwards discovers himself in possession of the severed fingers of his assailant has been  documented in England as far back as 1960. Since then, numerous versions have circulated, with the event described as recent and local. People find solace in it not only because the set-upon, almost-victim escapes unharmed, but also because one of the toughs pays a heavy price for his belligerence. (The theme of the bad guy getting his just deserts is prized in urban lore, especially when his punishment comes about through his own rotten actions.) The legend is much older than the 1960 date which only applies to the automobile version of it. Chamber's 1824 Traditions of England contains a tale about a party of drunks who smash upon the door knocker of someone's home. The next morning, part of a finger is discovered sticking to remnants of the knocker. A 1752 Swedish version tells of a crofter who, rowing home one evening, severs the fingers of a troll attempting to sink his boat. Notably, a very recognizable version of the current legend was kicking about centuries earlier, as demonstrated by this excerpt from La Nouvelle Fabrique des Excellents Traits de Vérité, a French collection of 99 tall tales first published in 1579: One day a man of the world, vigorous, alert, pleasing and as brave at least as Richard the Lion-Heart, was travelling along a narrow forest path when he saw a thief on the look-out, in among the trees, and he came out at him, putting his hand on the horse's bridle and saying: \"Hold! Your money or your life!\" The traveller, who was not easily frightened, immediately seizes his sword and gives him such a blow on the hand holding his horse that he cuts it clean off. Having done this, he spurs his horse and rides off so swiftly that he arrives home very soon after. His servant took his horse and led it to the stable; but when he came to unharness it, he noticed a hand hanging from the bridle, which gave him a nasty fright; surprised as he was, he dashed off into the house where, all a-tremble, he told him how he had found a severed hand still holding the horse's bridle. At first the master did not seem at all moved by his account, but after thinking about it for a while he recalled having hit out with his sword at a highwayman who had stopped his horse; whereupon he went to fetch the said hand, which he detached from the bridle with great difficulty and then nailed it on his front door as a trophy. Oftentimes, folks are surprised to discover that accounts they've heard as recent horrific occurrences that capture so well the specter of mindless random violence afoot in our society have existed as folklore not just all over the globe, but also well before the current century. This is the case here. Not only has the Severed Fingers tale made its way around the world in modern times, but it's demonstrably more than four centuries old. Another oldie of this ilk is the Hairy-Armed Hitchhiker legend, a version of which antedates the American Civil War. Motifs are commonly shared among legends. Another tale featuring a bad guy's severed fingers is the Choking Doberman, a story about a distressed guard dog and the gruesome find dislodged from its throat. The urban legend classic The Hook shares the \"menacing item afterwards found on the car the almost-victims escaped in\" element with the severed fingers legend. Barbara \"common shares\" Mikkelson Sightings: You'll find this legend used in the 1979 film Mad Max. Last updated: 29 March 2011

"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/pop-rocks-soda/" "false" "A longtime rumor is still bubbling up." "Barbara Mikkelson" 2000-07-31 "Little Mikey of LIFE cereal fame died from the explosive effects of mixing Pop Rocks candy with soda pop." "Invented in 1956 by General Foods research scientist William A. Mitchell and introduced to the general public in 1975, Pop Rocks were a form of carbonated candy made from sugar, lactose, corn syrup, and flavoring. These fruit-flavored nuggets released small amounts of carbonation when the candy was ingested, causing a mild \"exploding\" sensation and resulting in a satisfying \"sizzling\" noise kids loved. Though the confection had been extensively tested and found safe, the combustive candy still alarmed residents in Seattle. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) set up a telephone hotline there to assure anxious parents that the fizzing candy would not cause children to choke. Nevertheless, among kids, wild stories about the perils of eating Pop Rocks abounded. (Kids love ghastly rumors about candy (e.g., that Bubble Yum contains spiders or their eggs.) Example: [Collected on the Internet, 1994] A kid ate 6 bags of pop rocks at a party. He then proceeded to drink a 6-pack of Pepsi. The two substances combined in his stomach and exploded, killing him horribly. That's why pop rocks were taken off the market in the early eighties. Mixing the candy with carbonated drinks would cause the stomach to explode, was the popular whisper. Further, according to playground lore, the overly-cute kid known as \"Little Mikey,\" who achieved fame through starring in a LIFE cereal commercial with his two brothers, had died of this combination: Why Little Mikey, of all people? We can only guess, but urban legends require victims who are known yet anonymous — the ubiquitous friends of a friend — to lend them a touch of credible realism without allowing for the easy verification of their details. Little Mikey was a kid known to all other children by virtue of his famous television commercial, yet he was still relatively anonymous: few people (adults included) knew his real name, and his seeming non-appearance in any public role subsequent to his well known LIFE commercial (even though he actually took part in over 200 more commercials) could therefore plausibly be attributed to his untimely demise. Contrary to the rumor, John Gilchrist, the lad who played Mikey, not only survived his childhood unexploded but is now director of media sales for MSG Networks. Newsday reported of him in 2012 that: Yes, John Gilchrist enjoys Life cereal and keeps it in his home. No, he does not get a free lifetime supply. No, he was not a particularly picky eater as a child. Yes, he really is the guy who played one on TV.Oh, and one more thing: He is most certainly not dead. \"The folklore is that I ate Pop Rocks, the exploding candies, and I drank a soda and my stomach blew up,\" he said, recalling a long-ago urban legend. One day in the late 1970s, his mother summoned him from a playground baseball game to tell him she had received a call from a concerned friend who said, through tears, \"I'm so sorry to hear about your son.\" Replied Mrs. Gilchrist: \"He just came home from school!\" General Foods was battling \"exploded kid\" rumors as early as 1979, a scant four years after the product's introduction. They took out full-page ads in 45 major publications, wrote some 50,000 letters to school principals around the country, and sent the confection's inventor on the road to explain to all and sundry that Pop Rocks generate less gas than half a can of soda and ingesting them could induce nothing worse in the human body than a hearty, non-life-threatening belch. Despite all these measures, the rumors abound even to this day. The company stopped marketing Pop Rocks around 1983, and this is often pointed to as \"proof\" that the candy was so harmful it had to be pulled from the shelves. What's less known is that Kraft bought the rights to the product from General Foods in 1985 and then marketed it as \"Action Candy\" through a company named Carbonated Candy. Pop Rocks are now back out in the open, though, and are again marketed under their original Pop Rocks name. In July 2001, a northern California couple announced they were suing Baskin-Robbins after their five-year-old daughter swallowed Pop Rocks contained in the ice cream chain's \"Shrek Swirl\" flavor, maintaining that their daughter \"woke up from her nap screaming in pain\" and was taken to a medical facility where \"doctors had to insert a tube into her stomach to remove the air.\" In 2006, the \"exploded kid\" legend was revived, albeit with a newer candy, when rumors told of a Brazilian child who died after ingesting a combination of Coca-Cola and Mentos. It too was fiction. Barbara \"get a bang out of LIFE\" Mikkelson Sightings: In the 1998 slasher classic Urban Legend, the folklore professor invites a co-ed to eat Pop Rocks and then down a soda. She refuses to do it because she knows it kills people, including \"that kid in the cereal commercial.\"

"Barbara Mikkelson" 2000-07-25 "A damaged saguaro cactus fell onto the man who had harmed it and killed him." "People sometimes do foolish, unthinking things. Most of the time, they get away with them, but not always. Example: In southern Arizona they have the sorts of cacti that have great arms like you see on old westerns, called
saguaros. they're quite protected by various laws and live to be hundreds of years old. The story goes that some guy was out with his shotgun shooting signs and such. Well, he decided to blast some cacti too. As he stood within a few feet, perhaps 10, of a giant old cactus, he blasted a few holes in its giant trunk. It gave way and fell right on top of him, crushing and impaling him with nail-like spikes. He died, being alone and unable to crawl away. In 1982, roommates David Grundman and James Joseph Suchochi decided to pack up their guns and go wandering in the desert two miles north of Arizona 74, just west of Lake Pleasant. One or both of them was struck with the brilliant notion of taking pot shots at saguaro they found growing there. Maybe it was the devil in them. Maybe it had to do with the eerily manlike shapes these monstrous plants can grow into. Grundman shot a small saguaro in the trunk so many times that it thudded to the ground. \"The first one was easy!\" he cried, according to Suchochi. He next chose a specimen which stood 26 feet high and was estimated to be a hundred years old. Before the ringing in his ears had stopped, a four-foot spiny arm, severed by the blast, fell on Grundman and crushed him. Grundman's demise was chronicled in \"Saguaro,\" a song by the Texas band, the Austin Lounge Lizards. There are other stories in urban lore about Nature's children taking revenge on their human tormentors (the dynamite dog and Gucci kangaroo, for instance), but this is the only one where a plant strikes back. Then again, the saguaro is one very special plant. Saguaros are tall cactuses that can reach heights of 60 feet and grow only in the Sonoran Desert, which straddles the U.S.-Mexico border in the southwestern United States. For the first 75 years of their lives, they have only huge central trunks; their distinctive outstretched and upwards-bent arms develop later, if at all. Their usual lifespan is 150 to 200 years, though some have lived to be 300. Oh, one other fact about saguaros; they can weigh up to eight tons. As Grundman found out." 2000 "Jul" 7 1980

"Claim: A little boy dies after being pricked by a heroin-filled syringe in a playground ball pit. Status: False. Example: [Collected on the Internet, 1999]  Some of you might not be parents, but you may have nieces, nephews, grandchildren or friends with children this will pertain to you too. As I read the following, my heart sank. I urge each and every one of you to pass this on to as many people as you can. I cannot stress how important this is! This is very disturbing news. In addition to the following true story, I will also add that my own sons were playing in the ball pit at Discovery Zone one day. One son lost his watch, and was very upset. We dug and dug in those balls, trying to find the watch. Instead, we found vomit, food, faeces, and other stuff I do not want to discuss. I went to the manager and raised heck. Came to find out, the ball pit is only cleaned out once a month. I have doubts that it is even done that often. My kids will never play in another ball pit. Now read
this Hi, My name is Lauren Archer, my son Kevin and I lived in Sugarland, TX. On October 2nd, 1994 I took my only son to McDonald's for his 3rd birthday. After he finished lunch, I allowed him to play in the ball pit. When he started whining later on, I asked him what was wrong, he pointed to the back of his pull-up and simply said \"Mommy, it hurts.\" But I couldn't find anything wrong with him at that time. I bathed him when we got home, and it was at that point when I found a welt on his left buttock. Upon investigating, it seemed as if there was something like a splinter under the welt. I made an appointment to have it taken out the next day, but soon he started vomiting and shaking, then his eyes rolled back into his head. From there, we went to the emergency room. He died later that night. It turned out that the welt on his buttock was the tip of a hypodermic needle that had broken off inside. The autopsy revealed that Kevin had died from heroine overdose. The next week, the police removed the balls from the ball pit and lo and behold. There was rotten food, several hypodermic needles: some full; some used; knives, half-eaten candy, diapers, feces, and the stench of urine. If a child is not safe in a child's play area then where? You can find the article on Kevin Archer in the October 10, 1994 issue of the Houston Chronicle. Please forward this to all loving mothers!
 Origins: Readers, take heart — as frightening as this story is, there's nothing to it. No little boy, named Kevin Archer or otherwise, died in such a fashion, in Sugarland, Texas, or anywhere else. (Later versions of this baseless scare placed the action in either Midland or Midrand, Texas, and occurring on 2 October 1999. Some versions simply stated the incident occurred in Midrand, with no U.S. state mentioned, which left a town in Africa under the gun.) 
The claim about the Houston Chronicle's running a story about the boy's death is equally false. The article doesn't exist, yet so many believed the e-mail's claim that there had been such an article, the paper was prompted to run a denial in February 2000 attempting to put down these rumors. The Midland Reporter-Telegram ran such a piece itself once a shift in the rumor made it appear this horrific apocryphal incident happened in that city. And, of course, McDonald's says there's nothing to this: Thank you for taking the time to contact McDonald's Corporation directly to receive accurate information regarding a rumor you have heard. We have thoroughly investigated this rumor and it is absolutely not true. There have been no such incidents ever reported at any McDonald's. In addition, there has never been an article in any newspaper regarding this rumor. Unfortunately these types of rumors bring unnecessary concerns for our customers. It is important to know that safety is a top priority at McDonald's, especially as it relates to children. We take many precautions to ensure our Playlands are safe. We do realize that the Internet is a \"hotbed\" for irresponsible rumors, and for that reason, we especially appreciate the fact that you have taken the time to contact McDonald's for the facts. I encourage you to share this e-mail with anyone who shares this rumor with you. Unfortunately these types of rumors bring unnecessary concerns for our customers.

 Chalk  this one up as yet another cautionary tale warning parents to not place their faith in the presumed safety of a child's surroundings. Though the tragedy described in \"Lauren Archer's\" e-mail is fictional, the danger of a tot coming into contact with a discarded syringe in one of those play nests is surprisingly real. Ball pit play areas aren't always kept in the best condition. Before letting your child loose in one, make sure the play area's maintenance staff spot cleans the pit once a day and washes all the balls every week. Diapers come off in ball pits, and half-eaten candy is routinely found in there. More disturbingly, syringes and knives have turned up in ball pits. Restaurant ball pits aren't the only play areas where children can encounter discarded syringes or knives. In July 2010, a six-year-old girl was pricked by a needle in a play area of a fast food restaurant in Wollongong, Australia. She was taken to a local doctor, and police are trying to find the person responsible for discarding the needle. Another \"death in the ball pit\" legend circulates on the Internet, this one about a tot who fatally encounters a nest of baby rattlesnakes lurking beneath the balls. It too is false.

"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/getting-waisted/" "false" "Did Cher have ribs removed to make her waist smaller? Did anybody?" "Barbara Mikkelson" 2000-06-22 "Cher had her lowest pair of ribs surgically removed to achieve an ultra-small waist." "In these days of surgical modification based on the underlying belief that anything is possible provided one is willing to pay to have it done, the rib removal lie lives on. No one wants to acknowledge that the Beautiful People got that way by dint of hard work and self-denial (or maybe through the sheer luck of genetics). It's far more satisfying to believe they brought in skilled surgeons to work magic on them. Such a belief provides comfort to those unhappy with their own physical realities; their failure to look like the model on the cover of Cosmo can be written off to the other gal's using unholy tactics, not to their own lack of discipline. The truth is complicated because many of the famous ladies we admire have had a bit of work done to improve what God gave them. The difference here is one of degree. As invasive as breast implants and nose jobs are, they're still surgery on a vastly different level than deboning. That a particular famous actress had her nosed bobbed shouldn't lead anyone to believe she also had her rib cage rifled. This rumor has been leveled at a succession of famous ladies envied for their hard bodies and/or small waists. Passing along the rumor becomes a way of dismissing these women as Frankensteinian creations rather than acknowledging that even members of the charmed circle have to do sit ups and watch what they eat. Female celebrities turned exercise mavens like Cher and Jane Fonda are especial targets for rumors of this kind because they're seen as committing the unforgivable crime of condescension. Not only are they rich, famous, and good-looking, they're now out to lecture the rest of us! In those cases, our urge to see the pedestal pulled out from under them runs strong. Variations on the Theme: Women who have been rumored to have spared ribs to the goddess of vanity are: Cher, Elizabeth Taylor, Jane Fonda, Racquel Welch, Tori Spelling, Pamela Anderson, Gina Lollobrigida, Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour, Kate Moss, Janet Jackson, Britney Spears, Kim Kardashian, and Shakira. Male rocker Marilyn Manson has also battled false rumors he's had ribs removed. In his case though, the procedure supposedly wasn't to reduce waist size; it was to facilitate oral self-gratification. (Alluding to this naughty rumor about Marilyn Manson, Rosie O'Donnell once joked that she'd had four ribs put in ... at Tony Roma's.) Though the list of shapely beauties this rumor has been tacked onto is always growing, no one has been victimized by the slander the way Cher has. In her case, the combination of an especially buff body, other surgeries she's made no secret of, and her 1991 book Cher/Forever Fit: The Lifetime Plan for Health, Fitness and Beauty have worked to keep the slander in action. The media hasn't always been a great help either. In 1988 the chic magazine Paris Match announced Cher had extensive cosmetic surgery performed on her body, including the removal of two ribs to ensure she kept a \"boyish\" figure. Cher sued the magazine, but the rumor gained even wider acceptance after being picked up from the Paris Match piece and run in other papers. That these stories were later corrected didn't do much to mitigate the impact of the rumor's first finding its way into those pages as revealed fact. Cher attempted to combat the story with common sense: \"If that [rumor] were true,\" she said, \"how could I do those health club commercials, in which I wear next to nothing? I'd be scarred all over. And could I wear the kind of clothes I do if I'd had all those many operations? Wouldn't there be visible scars everywhere? \"I've been up front about saying that I had my nose done, my breasts done, and had braces on my teeth. The rest is nonsense.\" Her public denials didn't make the rumors go away, though. In 1990 she hired British physician F.V. Nicolle to examine her and report on what he found. Nicolle guaranteed that Cher was no mere miracle of plastic surgery, proclaiming: \"This patient has consulted me because the media are repeatedly [misreporting] information regarding any surgery which she may have had done to her body. She has never had any surgery to her upper and lower eyelids [or] her cheekbones [or chin] ... All these areas represent her natural well-developed good looks and have never been touched by surgery.\" The doctor also put paid to the rumor that Cher had had ribs removed to achieve a narrow-waisted look. Still, the rumor continues to follow Cher: \"I've killed myself in the gym to have this body. It isn't like I have some amazing secret that nobody else has.\" If it's any comfort, at least the rumor is an old one. Numerous articles decrying cosmetic surgery and the narcissism that drives women to commit folly in their quest for the unattainable ideal body casually include the bald-faced statement that in Victorian times women would have their lowest set of ribs surgically removed to give them fashionable wasp waists. Such a detail is used to prove that there's nothing new under the sun, that women have been vain to the point of risking serious harm in generations long past as well. The current interest in implants and tucks seems almost reasonable in light of such earlier practices. Trouble is, there wasn't any such practice. Wasp waists were considered the height of feminine glory, and many a Victorian gal measured her attractiveness by how small she could render this part of her anatomy. (Those wondering if they'd fit in should know the Victorian waistline is thought to have ranged from 18 to 32 inches.) The modifications, however, stopped short of surgery: One ate very little and wore tight corsets to get that effect. To believe the Victorian rib removal canard is to believe that in an age when even the most uncomplicated of surgeries often proved fatal, women were lining up to take the risk and surgeons were happily sawing away. Never mind that anesthesia was still an iffy proposition and that post-surgical death due to infection claimed a horrifying number, according to this falsehood the fair sex was willing to take \"suffer to be beautiful\" down to new lows. A statistical report from the mid-1800s listed these fatality rates from amputations; expected fatality rates from rib removal should be similar: Valerie Steele, chief curator of The Museum at The Fashion Institute of Technology in New York City and an expert on corsets, says, \"No Victorians had ribs removed.\" The size of a number of corsets from that era that are on display in \"The Corset: Fashioning the Body\" exhibit leads some to conclude there might have been something to that rib removal whisper after all, but the tiniest of the shapely 19th-century corsets were likely worn by young, thin women who were also small in stature. As well, upper-class children were required to wear corsets in the 18th and 19th centuries; those so appareled from childhood had their rib cages narrowed by these devices, accounting for some of these astonishingly small foundation garments. Corsets have come back into fashion again, with their rise in popularity spawning a growing industry to satisfy this fashion need. However, it's not only the ladies who wear this particular form of undergarment. One of the most famous corset-wearers of our time is male: Mr. Pearl has, through the use of corsetry, trained his waist from a measurement of 31 inches down to 18 inches. He admits to wearing his corset 24 hours a day, loosening it only for bathing. (Men wore tight corsets in the 19th century to give them a more military-appearing bearing under their uniforms and also to provide back support.) It's possible the rumor about women having ribs removed to make their waists smaller was deliberately started in the late 1890s by impresario Florenz Ziegfeld, Jr. (of the Ziegfeld Follies), who was then heavily engaged in generating publicity for Anna Held, an actress whose career he was directing. (The pair also had a relationship away from the footlights — they lived together from 1897 until 1909). Held was one of the beauties of her day and was celebrated for her 18 inch waist. To build interest in her (and so sell more tickets to her performances), Ziegfeld fed the press many a far-fetched tale about Held, including the laugher that she daily bathed in milk for its purported beneficial effects upon the skin. While it is not definitively known that he spread the tale about her having had rib removal surgery to achieve her famed wasp waist, it well fits with his abilities to work the press — he never seemed to regard any claims about any of his performers as too wild to feed to them, knowing that while they might scoff at some of the stories, they would repeat them in print and so add to the publicity being generated. Under that hypothesis, a false story deliberately generated to excite the public's interest in Anna Held later attached to other small-waisted actresses and singers, as the legend updated itself to stay current with the times. Yet however the story began, it is and always has been a false one. While vanity has at times driven both sexes to commit horrendous excesses, having a few ribs taken out wasn't any of them. And the truth value of that statement does not alter when the name of a celebrity is tossed into the mix." 2000 "Jun" 6 1890

I didn't think much of it until now. The reason we were a little suspicious is we had been riding in a jeep all day with <NOBR>100 degrees</NOBR> temps and we stopped at a truck stop for something to drink. When I was leaving, a young girl followed me out and asked what kind of cologne I was wearing. Well, after <NOBR>7 hours</NOBR> in the car sweating, I don't think you could tell I was or was not wearing any cologne. We just got in the jeep and said no thanks. Then it was about 3 weeks ago, I was at a service station in Birmingham getting gas. It was about <NOBR>9:30 pm.</NOBR> I was approached by <NOBR>2 men</NOBR> and <NOBR>2 women</NOBR> in a car. The man that was driving asked me 'What kind of perfume do you wear?' I was a bit confused and I asked him 'Why?' He said, 'We are selling some name brand perfumes, at cheap prices.' I said I had no money. He then reached out of the car and handed me paper that was laminated; it had many perfumes on it. I looked quickly at it and gave it back. I said, I have no money. He said it is OK, we take check, cash, or credit cards. Then the people in the car began to laugh. I just got in my car and said no thanks. Then I received this e-mail yesterday and it sent chills up my spine. Please read this. It is no joke. Here is the <NOBR>e-mail</NOBR> I was sent. Dear Friends: I know not all of you are women that I am sending this to, but am hoping you will share this with your wives, daughters, mothers, sisters, etc. Our world seems to be getting crazier by the day. Pipe bombs in mailboxes and sickos in parking lots with perfume. Be careful. I was approached yesterday afternoon around <NOBR>5:30 PM</NOBR> in the Walmart parking lot by two males asking what kind of perfume I was wearing. Then they asked if I'd like to sample some fabulous scent they were willing to sell me at a very reasonable rate. I probably would have agreed had I not received an <NOBR>e-mail</NOBR> warning of a \"Wanna smell this neat perfume?\" scam. The men continued to stand between parked cars, I guess to wait for someone else to hit on. I stopped a lady going towards them, pointing at them and told her about how I was sent an <NOBR>e-mail</NOBR> at work about someone walking up to you at the malls or in parking lots and asking you to SNIFF PERFUME that they are selling at a cheap price. THIS IS NOT PERFUME...IT IS ETHER! When you sniff it, you'll pass out. They'll take your wallet, your valuables and heaven knows what else.

I wanted to do the same for you. PLEASE PASS THIS ALONG TO ALL YOUR WOMEN FRIENDS AND PLEASE BE ALERT AND BE AWARE. IF YOU ARE A MAN AND RECEIVE THIS, PASS IT ON TO YOUR WOMEN FRIENDS. Ladies, this happened to me yesterday and I didn't smell the perfume either, thanks to this email. This is true. Believe me, I know. I was over by <NOBR>Big Lots</NOBR> in the parking lot at lunch time when I was approached. So either day or night, it does not matter. There were <NOBR>3 guys</NOBR> together when I was approached. I called the police when I got back to my desk. Like the email says above, LET EVERYONE KNOW ABOUT THIS - YOUR FRIENDS, FAMILY, CO-WORKERS, whomever. It helped me.

wanted to do the same for you. PASS THIS ALONG TO ALL YOUR WOMEN FRIENDS, AND PLEASE BE ALERT, AND AWARE!! The scenario described above isn't a real danger. No one has reported having been robbed in this manner, save for one woman in 1999 whose claim was suspect (for reasons we discuss below). This legend doesn't even describe a plausible scenario because, despite what books and television shows may depict, rendering a person unconscious from a mere sniff or two of some substance is not easy to do. Ether is nasty, volatile stuff that requires a great deal more than a few brief inhalations to knock a person out. In fact, it's hard to think of any substance that could produce the instant unconsciousness described here. This legend appears to have begun in late 1999 with a widely-circulated Internet message that used one specific news report as a basis for implying that ether-wielding robbers were a potentially widespread menace: Watch out-this is for real! I just heard on the radio about a lady that was asked to sniff a bottle of perfume that another woman was selling for $8.00 (In a mall parking lot). She told the story that it was her last bottle of perfume that regularly sells for $49.00 but she was getting rid of it for only $8.00, sound legitimate? That's what the victim thought, but when she awoke she found out that her car had been moved to another parking area and she was missing all her money that was in her wallet (total of $800.00). Pretty steep for a sniff of perfume! Anyway, the perfume wasn't perfume at all, it was some kind of ether or strong substance to cause anyone who breathes the fumes to black out.
SO, Please beware ... Christmas time is coming and we will be going to malls shopping and we will have cash on us. Ladies, please don't be so trusting of others and beware of your surroundings-ALWAYS! Obey your instincts! The incident described above was \"real\" in the sense that a Mobile, Alabama, woman claimed it happened to her on 8 November 1999 and reported the alleged robbery to the police, but it's false in that no evidence ever surfaced to verify her story. Bertha Johnson, a 54-year-old Mobile woman, maintained that at about 2:00 PM on Monday, 8 November, she had pulled into the parking lot of a bank when a woman approached her car and offered to sell her bottles of cologne that ordinarily retail for $45 for the low price of $8. Ms. Johnson says she sniffed a sample of the cologne, and the next thing she knew it was around half an hour later, she was standing with her keys in her hand at a wicker store two miles away from the bank, her head was throbbing, and $800 she had been carrying ($500 of her own money plus $300 of her employer's) was missing. However, her claim had some surface implausibilities: Sure enough, several weeks later the toxicology reports concerning tests run on blood and urine samples taken from Ms. Johnson immediately after the alleged attack did not indicate the presence of any unusual or abnormal substance in her system. The case remained officially open, but this one smelled like a scam cooked up by Ms. Johnson to abscond with her employer's money. Now, in true urban legend fashion, this tale has gone from a news report of an alleged victim's unsubstantiated story to a general warning that this sort of thing might happen to you to a specific warning that this type of robbery is actually happening. It isn't happening though, and it probably never did, not even once. It's interesting to see how little occurrences that aren't even part of the scenario described are now being reported as evidence of narrow brushes with these non-existent robbers. For example, the following was prefaced to one e-mailed example: Some of you got this email some weeks ago like me. I just wanted to pass along that I was approached yesterday afternoon at around 3:30 p.m. in the Wal-Mart parking lot at Forest Drive by 2 males asking what kind of perfume I was wearing. I didn't stop to answer them and kept walking toward the store. At the same time I remembered this email. The men continued to stand between parked cars — I guess to wait on someone else to hit on. I stopped a lady going toward them, pointed at them, and told her what they might ask and NOT to let them get near her. When that happened, the men and a lady (I don't know where she came from!) started walking the other way toward their car parked in far corner of the parking lot. I thank Jane Shirey for passing this along — it might have saved me from a robbery. I'm passing this along to you'all so you can warn the women in your life to watch out for this ... Now, men asking passing women about the perfume they're wearing isn't at all the same thing as crooks using rigged perfume bottles to knock out their victims. The fact is, some companies (such as Scentura) do hire people to sell perfume door-to-door or in parking lots, and some of these salespeople do indeed work in pairs, pitch their wares from cars, and employ aggressive sales tactics (which include approaching women and asking them what kind of perfume they have on). But now that this legend is circulating, people dutifully report any sighting of perfume-selling strangers in parking lots as \"proof\" of this fictional crime wave of ether-bearing robbers being real. Indeed, we routinely receive e-mails from women who have had encounters with folks vending perfume in parking lots and who have concluded (based on nothing but spurious rumor) that they were about to be robbed. They write to report we're all wrong about this sort of robbery not taking place because hadn't they themselves almost had it happen to them? That no \"knockout potions\" were offered to them and no robberies (completed or attempted) took place does little to dissuade them from their certainty that they came within a hair's breadth of harm at the hands of some innocent freelance perfume sellers. We wrote the original article about this rumor in 2000. As far along as April 2006, Alabama police were still having to field reports on this non-existent form of crime and inform the public that it's a hoax: Police are debunking as a hoax reports of a man trying to use ether to abduct a young girl outside Eastdale Mall. Capt. Huey Thornton said the report, generated in an e-mail circulating throughout Montgomery, is false. Thornton said the people named in the e-mail asserted their daughter was approached by a man outside the mall, but that details of the e-mail have been \"significantly embellished.\" The e-mail states that investigators told the couple a man posing as a perfume salesman had asked other young girls to \"smell the perfume on his hand,\" which turned out to be ether. \"The Montgomery Police Department is not familiar with any cases in the city where a subject matching the description in the e-mail has approached anyone posing as a perfume salesman or any cases where ether has been involved.\" Since 2000 (when we wrote our original article), we've been keeping our ears and eyes open for news of any instances of this sort of robbery happening in real life. So far, the closest thing to arise is a July 2008 case in a town in Louisiana. In Houma, Louisiana, a woman named Patches Wegmann was arrested after two men she plied with cologne claimed to have suffered ill effects from what she'd had them breathe in. The first said she accosted him, sprayed a cologne sample on a piece of paper, and waved it under his nose. Subsequently, after he returned to work, he passed out, his symptoms including dizziness, shortness of breath, and numbness in his extremities. The second said the cologne's fumes left him feeling light-headed, and it irritated his skin. Wegmann was charged with second-degree battery and unlawful solicitation, but the battery charge has to do with forcing perfume samples upon unwilling parties, not because there was anything necessarily noxious in the substance she forced upon them. The incident remains under investigation, and authorities say it’s not clear that anything other than perfume was sprayed on either man. In 2001 a false Internet rumor about seven women having died after sniffing perfume samples sent to them in the mail spread in the wake of the September 11 attacks. This newer rumor was a combination of two older and equally baseless scares: the 1999 \"perfume robbers\" tale (which is the topic of the article above) and the 2000 Klingerman Virus warning about blue virus-laden sponges mailed in envelopes marked \"A gift for you from the Klingerman Foundation\" which supposedly caused 23 deaths. The 2001 \"deadly perfume samples\" rumor brought into play the specter of lurking terrorists using the U.S. mail system to murder the innocent in a women-targeted replay of the anthrax mailings horror. The \"deadly perfume samples\" rumor is distinct and indeed far removed from the \"perfume robbers\" one, yet folks are prone to confuse the two because they both use the word 'perfume.' <FONT COLOR=\"\" class=\"copyright_text_color_g\"><B>Additional information:</B></FONT> &nbsp; <TABLE CELLSPACING=16> <TR> <TD> &nbsp; &nbsp; <a HREF=\"https://web.archive.org/web/19991128085208/https://www.al.com/news/mobile/Nov1999/10-a204984a.html\" onMouseOver=\"window.status='Victim Didn't Detect Any Strange Odor';return true\" onMouseOut=\"window.status='';return true\" TARGET=odor><IMG WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=40 ALT=\"Victim Didn't Detect Any Strange Odor\" SRC=\"https://www.snopes.com/uploads/images/graphics/icons/news/document.gif\" ALIGN=ABSMIDDLE BORDER=0></A></TD> <TD><FONT COLOR=#FF0000>Victim Didn't Detect Any Strange Odor <I>(Mobile Register)</I></FONT></TD> </TR> <TR> <TD> &nbsp; &nbsp; <a HREF=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20021216035216/https://www.dogwoodproductions.com/mobilepd/pressreleases/pressreleases.cgi?action=fullscreen&key=942105863\" onMouseOver=\"window.status='Woman Dazed After Being Asked to Smell Unknown Substance';return true\" onMouseOut=\"window.status='';return true\" TARGET=pr><IMG WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=40 ALT=\"Woman Dazed After Being Asked to Smell Unknown Substance\" SRC=\"https://www.snopes.com/uploads/images/graphics/icons/news/document.gif\" ALIGN=ABSMIDDLE BORDER=0></A></TD> <TD><FONT COLOR=#FF0000>Woman Dazed After Being Asked to Smell Unknown Substance <I>(Mobile Police Department)</I></FONT></TD> </TR> <TR> <TD> &nbsp; &nbsp; <a HREF=\"https://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060427/NEWS/604270349/1001\" onMouseOver=\"window.status='Police Say E-Mail Report Is a Hoax';return true\" onMouseOut=\"window.status='';return true\" TARGET=pr><IMG WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=40 ALT=\"Police Say E-Mail Report Is a Hoax\" SRC=\"https://www.snopes.com/uploads/images/graphics/icons/news/document.gif\" ALIGN=ABSMIDDLE BORDER=0></A></TD> <TD><FONT COLOR=#FF0000>Police Say E-Mail Report Is a Hoax <I>(Montgomery Advertiser)</I></FONT></TD> </TR>" 2000 "Jun" 6 1000

"Barbara Mikkelson" 2000-06-07 "After the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, a car thief was found crushed to death under a collapsed freeway overpass in the vehicle he'd stolen." "Claim: After the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, a car thief was found crushed to death under a collapsed freeway overpass in the vehicle he'd stolen. FALSE Examples:  A man by the name of Jones purchased his dream car on October 17, 1989, a fancy red Porsche. It's what he always wanted. He drove off the lot and headed straight to the third game of the World's Series at Candlestick Park in Oakland, California [sic]. During that historic game, an incredible earthquake hit the city of San Francisco. The game was called off. People came running out of the stadium for their lives. Not only was the game canceled, but he went out there to his dismay, not only had an earthquake hit, but his car had been stolen, as well. A thief had taken his car. The car remained missing for several days as the police were preoccupied with the devastation of the earthquake. Finally they found his red Porsche. It was discovered underneath the collapsed Nimitz freeway. And the thief was still in it. He had died in the car he snatched.
 
 [Collected on the Internet, 1990] This sounds like an urban myth, but I trust the teller. A friend from Berkeley just started working for the University. His supervisor had the following tale to tell: The supervisor and his brother were going off to the 3rd game of the World Series on Oct. 17. The brother was taking his new car, a pure white Mercedes with gold trim. He'd bought it three days before. They get to the game, park, and go to the stands. The earthquake hits. Everyone cheers. Everyone goes out to their cars. However, our two heroes can't find their car — it's been stolen. Somehow they get home, tell the insurance company, and go on with their lives. A couple weeks ago, the insurance company phoned back saying that they'd found the car. In fact, they'd found the thief as well — he was in the car when they found it ... in the Cypress Structure, crushed to six inches high ... The brother was horrified, but Andy's supervisor was really happy. \"Yes, there is justice in this world!\"
 Variations:
   Origins: At 5:04 P.M. on 17 October 1989, the Loma Prieta earthquake struck the San Francisco area. This 7.1 shaker wrought widespread turmoil in the Bay area, killing 62 people, injuring another 3,757 and causing property damage in excess of $6 billion (including rendering the San Francisco Bay Bridge unusable for a month). Out of all those 62 earthquake-related deaths, not one of them was a crushed car thief in a stolen automobile. This little story has no factual basis although it was passed along as  a believed tale shortly after the quake. It reappeared again after the 17 January 1994 Northridge quake, that time told as a true event that had occurred in the Los Angeles area. Once again, no crushed car thieves were numbered among the Northridge dead. [Note that the first example of this legend above isn't even consistent in its details. A car thief departing from Oakland-Alameda County Stadium (as it was then called) would likely use the Nimitz Freeway as an escape route, but the World Series game scheduled for the day of the quake was at Candlestick Park in San Francisco. This inconsistency is likely an attempt to tie together the famous images of the collapsed section of the Nimitz Freeway and the damaged car on the Bay Bridge.] Those who pass along this legend are often vague about whom it happened to (details about the thief or victim are rarely given), yet a full description of the car is an integral part of the narrative. Its make, model, year, color, and special markings (which vary from telling to telling, by <IMG ALT=\"Collapsed bridge\" HEIGHT=284 WIDTH=200 SRC=\"https://www.snopes.com/uploads/images/horrors/graphics/bridge.jpg\" ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=16 VSPACE=16 BORDER=1> the way) are lovingly described. These details give the legend that little extra push needed to make owner's grief at losing his car more palpable and the thief's act more heinous. This wasn't an ordinary car, says the legend; this was someone's baby. One is thus encouraged to view the car thief more as a kidnapper than a mere vehicle booster and to agree with the thrust of the story: the scoundrel got what he deserved. It is that theme of just deserts served up in full portion that speeds this legend along. No one relishes the thought of being victimized in a crime, and compounding that distaste is the knowledge that all too often the perpetrators get away with their misdeeds. In this legend at least, the wrong-doer was brought to justice by his criminal action. Had he not been making off with a stolen vehicle, he wouldn't have lost his life. Just as the dead thief legend surfaces in the wake of major U.S. earthquakes, so too does the beloved chestnut about a mysterious hitchhiker who just prior to the disaster delivers a dire prophecy from the back seat of a car moments before disappearing into thin air. The doom-saying hitchhiker is a version of the well-known Vanishing Hitchhiker legend. Barbara \"hitch in the plans\" Mikkelson Additional information:  Last updated: 16 October 2014

"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/too-young-to-dye/" "false" "Did President Calvin Coolidge's son die from blood poisoning caused by the dye in his black socks?" "David Mikkelson" 2000-05-24 "President Calvin Coolidge's son was killed by a poisonous dye in his black socks." "Claim: President Calvin Coolidge's son was killed by a poisonous dye in his black socks. FALSE Origins: When President Warren G. Harding died unexpectedly of heart disease on 2 August 1923, Vice-President Calvin Coolidge was <IMG HSPACE=16 VSPACE=16 WIDTH=220 HEIGHT=234 ALT=\"Socks\" SRC=\"https://www.snopes.com/uploads/images/horrors/graphics/socks.jpg\" ALIGN=RIGHT BORDER=0> sworn in as President of the United States. Before long, rumors began to spread that Harding, whose administration had been marred by scandals both personal and political, had been poisoned, either by his own hand or by that of his vindictive wife. Within a year, a less sinister but equally bizarre poisoning rumor would attach itself to a tragic death in the Coolidge family as well. On 30 June 1924, Coolidge's two sons, John and Calvin Jr., set out to play tennis on the White House tennis court. 16-year-old Calvin Jr., in a hurry to get out on the court, donned tennis shoes but no socks. Young Calvin's sockless exertions raised a blister on one of his toes, which soon became infected. The modern antibiotics that would quickly clear up such an infection today did not exist in 1924, and by the time White House physicians were summoned to treat Calvin Jr., it was too late: he died of pathogenic blood poisoning a week later. President Coolidge blamed himself for his son's death, and many have claimed that it plunged him into a depression from which he never recovered. The strange death of such a prominent young man naturally attracted the attention of the nation. Before long a rumor began circulating (particularly among teenagers) that Calvin Jr.'s death was caused by the dye from his black socks entering his bloodstream through a cut and poisoning him. How this rumor began is something we can only guess at, and no obvious explanations spring to mind. Obviously the public knew that whatever killed Calvin had something to do with a wound on his foot and blood poisoning, so perhaps the sock rumor arose because it seemed like a logical explanation to those who were not privy to the details of his injury. Or perhaps, as Morgan and Tucker suggested in their book More Rumor!, it may simply have been \"the result of youthful anxiety about dress and appearance.\" Either way, the claim may have seemed plausible at the time because some of the coloring agents commonly used by the clothing industry (such as zinc chloride, which was used to give socks a pearl gray color, and aniline dye, which was used to make shoe leather black) did indeed often cause serious inflammations when the unabsorbed chemicals came into contact with a wearer's skin.

"Barbara Mikkelson" 2000-05-21 "An elderly pet owner accidentally kills her animal companion by attempting to dry it in a microwave oven." "Examples: [Smith, 1983] I once heard of an elderly lady who used to breed pedigree cats and exhibit them at shows. She specialised in Persian cats and their long hair always made it a difficult task to clean and groom them for showing. In order to cut down the effort involved the old lady had evolved the practice of first washing the cat, towelling it dry and then, finally, giving it a very brief warming in her electric oven. One Christmas her cooker developed a fault and so her son, by way of a Christmas present, brought her a brand new microwave oven. On the day of the next cat show, not understanding the basic difference in the technology between an ordinary cooker and a microwave oven, the old lady industriously washed her prize-winning Persian cat and popped it into the oven for a few seconds. There really was no miaow, nor any noise at all from the cat, for the poor creature exploded the instant the oven was switched on. [Healey & Glanvill, 1996] A rich elderly lady from Harrogate was taking her pet poodle for a walk when they were caught in a downpour. Rushing back inside, fretful for her pampered pet, she was desperate to dry him out and warm him up as soon as possible. So she took him straight into the kitchen, opened the door of her daughter's new microwave cooker for the first time, and thrust him in, moving the dial to a moderate setting. She patted his head and carefully closed the door with a click. The old lady was still drying her hair when the cooked dog exploded, ripping the door off the microwave. [Collected on the Internet, 1998] There was some woman who had a dog, which she would put in the oven to dry off after giving him baths. I thought this was stupid enough, but then the woman gets a microwave oven. While being \"dried off\" in the microwave, the dog explodes and (obviously) dies. That's stupid enough. But the woman sued the company which made the microwave for some obscene amount of money — and won. Because there was no warning label on the microwave oven. Variations:  Origins: The legend about the microwaved pet has been with us since 1976, but its antecedents were around long before that. If lore is to be believed, foolhardy old ladies have been attempting to dry wet pets in clothes dryers and conventional ovens long before the invention of the microwave oven. A 1942 tale in which a roasted cat is discovered in a wood-burning oven has been pointed to as a predecessor to this more modern tale about current domestic technology. In it, however, the cat gets into the oven under its own power; its mistress has no idea it is in there until she later discovered the crisped kitty. A related Russian legend tells of a mother whose custom was to bathe her child in a tub of warm water. She places the tub (with Junior in it) on top of the unlit wood stove, and goes to speak to a neighbor. The gossip session stretches out longer than anticipated. Upon return to her kitchen, she discovers a draft through the open back door has caused the fire to rekindle under the child and her baby now lies dead in the tub. These older variations on the same theme cast doubt on the widely-accepted theory that this legend is about fear of new technology. Other \"cooked to death\" legends include: Although there have been a few verifiable cases of pets subjected to microwaving, each of them were deliberate acts of cruelty, perpetrated by twisted souls who knew all too well what they were doing. Micropoochings arising from a lack of understanding of the technology, however, are still incidents of lore only. Depending upon how this legend is viewed, there are two different interpretations: If seen as a \"fear of new technology\" legend, the little old lady of lore becomes a symbol of technological incompetence. Both female and old, she is the stereotypical embodiment of someone who could have little possible interest in how new things work and thus highly at risk of fatally misusing newfangled contraptions. Her misadventure serves as a warning to not place our faith in the new over the time-honored. Convenience be damned; the old ways are safer, says the legend. Stick with what is known. But there's another possible interpretation, one that fits the older tales about pets dying in conventional ovens and clothes dryers. In the stereotypical world of urban legends, little old ladies are seen as lonely figures unduly attached to their animal companions. By casting an elderly woman in this tale, the loss of a beloved pet is seen as that much more catastrophic. We picture the old woman as having done in the one thing she had left in her life to lavish love on. Under this interpretation, the legend becomes one of that gives voice to our fears of growing old alone.

"Barbara Mikkelson" 2000-05-14 "Horrified onlookers notice that the enthralling stranger dancing with a pretty girl from the village has cloven hooves." "This legend is quite well known in the Southwestern United States, but is almost unheard of in any other part of the U.S. It is said that one of the last Sundays [before Lent] a servant woman went to confession and communion. Despite the reprimands of her mother, an honest laundress, who warned her not to desecrate the day by mundane festivities, she couldn't resist the temptation and was going that same night to dance at The Vineyard [a ballroom situated in an inner suburb of Danzig]. The punishment for her impiety came quickly. Around midnight, she saw a handsomely dressed stranger with black hair and eyes that glistened like onyx, coming towards her to ask her for a dance. She took his arm with pleasure as they began to dance with perfect grace, but faster and faster . . . One of the musicians watched the dancing people carefully, and one can imagine how he felt when he noticed that the stranger had the cloven hoof of Satan! He drew his comrades' attention to it, and in the very middle of the waltz they were playing, they changed the tune and broke into a religous hymn. The clock struck twelve, the devil pulled his partner close to him and in a frantic whirl crossed with her to the other side of the room and crashed through the window. The girl was found lying on the green grass in the garden covered with broken glass. The devil had disappeared. It shows up in any number of other cultures, though. It was Halloween 1975 at the El Camaroncito Nite Club off Old Highway 90 [San Antonio] when a handsome stranger waltzed in and turned all the women's heads. A brilliant dancer, he had all the moves. Even the shyest girl in the room, says local historian and author Docia Williams, couldn't resist his request for a cumbia. \"But something strange happened when they were dancing,\" Williams said. \"For a moment the enchanted woman broke out of her almost hypnotic trance and she glanced to the floor. 'Your feet! Your feet!' she screamed, and tore herself from the tight embrace of her partner.\" Horrified patrons stared at the dance floor and saw long, skinny claws protruding from the stranger's trouser cuffs - chicken feet. \"It's the sign of the devil,\" Williams said. \"Other women began to scream and say prayers.\" Suddenly, the stranger disappeared into the men's restroom and left without a trace. That is, except for a strong smell of sulphur — the devil's scent. Numerous venerable legends describe encounters with witches or other diabolical beings whose identities are realized only once onlookers catch sight of the dancers' horse-like hooves or chicken feet. (According to lore, the only part of himself the Devil cannot transform when he takes human shape are his feet.) This legend has updated itself with the times, with the setting shifting from a fiesta or town dance to a dance club or disco. Sometimes even the name of the dance specified. A version making specific mention of the Lambada surfaced in 1992. The \"mysterious stranger revealed to be the Devil\" motif is common to many legends. Here's another: In an old cabin several men were playing poker by the light of a kerosene lantern. Money was lost and won, liquor flowed, but everyone was in a good mood and there were no fights. There was a knock at the door so one of the men answered it; the visitor was a tall dark stranger who asked if he could come in for the night. The men welcomed him and he started playing cards with them but soon they noticed he was winning all their money. One of the men dropped a card on the floor and bent down to pick it up. As he did this he glanced under the table — and saw that the stranger's feet were cloven hooves! In a panic he lunged up, knocking over the table and the kerosene lantern. The cabin caught fire and the men rushed out the door — all except for the stranger. Terrified, the men huddled under a tree until dawn. As the sun came up, they regained their courage and approached the cabin — and they discovered their silver money melted in the shape of an upside down cross." 2000 "May" 5 1970

"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/drugs-smuggled-in-dead-babies/" "false" "Cautionary drug tale posits that dealers use hollowed-out bodies of dead children to smuggle cocaine into the U.S." "Barbara Mikkelson" 2000-05-12 "Drug dealers use hollowed-out bodies of dead children to smuggle cocaine into the U.S." "The air hostess, as she passed along the aisle of the plane on the transatlantic flight from Amsterdam to New York noticed that the baby, nestled between the couple who were asleep, didn't look very well — in fact it looked extremely ill. Not wanting to disturb anyone she gently lifted up the baby and took it back to her station. Feeling the baby's forehead, she found it was cold and with a sudden panic she realized that the infant was dead. Calling upon a doctor she knew to be on board, he examined the baby and confirmed that, not only was it dead, but it was embalmed. The child's body had been hollowed out and it was full of the drugs that the couple were trying to smuggle into the States. A recent (late-1996) twist on this old tale that moves the story from its previously-given locale of either Miami or New York City to someplace along the Mexican/American border. In this newer telling of an age-old scare story, a young child disappears from his parents' sight at the border; maybe a half-hour later, the mother sees her \"sleeping\" child being carried by a man trying to clear Customs. She gives chase, he drops the child and gets away, and it's only then she discovers that her little boy has been brutally murdered and hollowed out to turn him into a smuggler's carrying case.  It's a horrifying tale, and it's meant to drive home the message that those who deal in drugs are inhuman and there are no limits to their depravity. The tale is sickeningly fascinating (thus ensuring it will be told and re-told), and it plays right into what we want to believe about those in the drug trade: They're through-and-through evil. Both those factors have contributed to this story's longevity. As a \"never forget, never end the war on drugs\" story, it's a blood-boiler, one guaranteed to outrage and turn the stomach of even the most sanguine. (Indeed, the example cited above suggests a depraved couple so single-mindedly determined to smuggle drugs into the USA that they're willing to sacrifice their own child to the cause.) Yet as horrible as this story is, there are no documented cases of its occurrence, much less any evidence of its being a common practice in the drug trade. A major outbreak of the story took place in 1985, at which time a Washington Post article about crime in Miami that presented the story as true. A week later that paper printed a retraction after discovering they had fallen for an apocryphal tale: Clifton Stallings, a spokesman for the U.S. Customs Service in Miami, said \"the story has been in circulation for some time. No one at Customs in Miami can verify it.\" Vann Capps, a Customs official in Miami, said he heard the story in a 1973 training course for inspectors at Hofstra University. \"They gave us different concealment techniques from past seizures, and this one involved cocaine concealed in the dead baby's body,\" Capps said. He said he believes the incident was alleged to have occurred at either the Miami airport or the John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York. A 1990 United Press International report noted this legend's staying power: For years, a bizarre tale of a cocaine-stuffed baby corpse has dogged Miami's drug agents. Experts and investigators said the ubiquitous legend may have been inspired by a fleeting reference in a British satire, a gruesome incident from the Vietnam war, or maybe only our own worst fears. According to the story, a Customs officer noticed a woman arriving in Miami with a pale and sickly looking baby. Upon closer inspection, he found the infant was dead and the corpse had been stuffed with cocaine in order to smuggle the drug into the country. The apocryphal tale is frequently cited as evidence of Miami decadence. It has popped up in publications as varied as the Washington Post, LIFE magazine and the National Enquirer. \"It crops up usually once a year,\" said Customs agent Clif Stallings. \"Playboy called back after they published it and were embarrassed about it. It was too late to do anything about it when they called. They had gone on someone's say-so. We told them, 'You've been stung.'\" Customs agents, police and the Drug Enforcement Administration insist the incident never really happened. They have denounced the tale for years but have never found its source. \"We interviewed people and tried to track that down and we just never could find any truth in it,\" Stallings said. \"It seemed to be something someone made up or it was a rumor. I'm not saying it couldn't happen but we never could track it down.\" Noted Tom Cash, agent in charge of the Miami DEA office, \"As a smuggling method that would be quite stupid because you'd certainly be limited to those occasions where you had access to the body of a baby. \"It sounds to me like an imaginative writer,\" Cash said. It may have been exactly that. A similar incident is mentioned in passing in Evelyn Waugh's 1937 novel Scoop. The book is a spoof on the gullibility of the press. It is about the author of a country gardening column who is accidentally sent to Africa to cover a colonial civil war for a London newspaper. The novice reporter has loaded up on tents, canoes and a bizarre assortment of equipment, and is shepherding his mountain of crates and parcels through French customs on his way to Africa. \"Not since an Egyptian lady had been caught cosseting an artificial baby stuffed with hashish, had the customs officials of Le Bourget had such a beano,\" the book says. The port changes from Le Bourget to Miami and the hashish turns into cocaine, but the basic elements of the tale are the same. Cash and Stallings said the story may also have been inspired by a famous heroin smuggler, Leslie Keith Atkinson, who found a novel way to ship heroin from southeast Asia during the Vietnam War. \"Leslie Kenneth Atkinson owned a bar in Saigon, the American Star Bar. He had some friends in graves registration who prepped the bodies that were sent to Fort Bragg, N.C. \"There was heroin secreted in the coffins at that time. This came out in post-arrest, or post-conviction testimony before Congress. I think it was put in the coffins, not the body cavities,\" Cash said. \"That was quite a famous case. I think that is the genesis of the cadaver-containing-drugs story.\" More recently, customs agents arrested a man who arrived at Miami International Airport with packets of cocaine sewn inside his legs. He was very much alive, but his wincing and stiff-legged gait gave him away. \"It's just a short jump from the cocaine in the thighs to the cocaine in the baby's body,\" Cash said. The thigh incident occurred just last year, however, long after the stuffed baby tale had achieved legendary status. In yet another demonstration of how urban legends are resurrected whenever they serve a purpose, this legend was reported as true by the international press (in this case the UK's Guardian) in May 2000 with a Middle Eastern setting: Drug smugglers abducted and killed a small girl, then stuffed her body with drugs in order to take them into a Gulf state, a senior police officer was reported as saying yesterday. Officials at the unnamed airport saw a woman cradling the child in her arms, apparently asleep. As the woman passed through immigration control an officer teased the child, but there was no response. Then he realised she was dead. Sympathy quickly turned to horror when officials discovered that the girl's body was packed with drugs. They concluded that she had been killed for the specific purpose of smuggling narcotics. Major Abdul Rahman Naser al-Fardan, head of the drugs squad in Sharjah, one of the seven states in the oil-rich United Arab Emirates, was describing how smugglers are resorting to increasingly desperate and cruel measures to conceal their wares. They have been known to pack drugs inside the Koran or in the frames of Islamic art. In one case a blind man had a white stick full of drugs. The Gulf has long been recognised as a staging post for drugs on the route from Pakistan and Afghanistan to Europe. It is also believed by some to be a money-laundering centre for the proceeds. In states where alcohol is prohibited and drugs offend social and religious sensibilities, the problem is officially portrayed as a foreign one. Asians are blamed for 80% of drug dealing and the authorities become coy at suggestions that part of the trade may be aimed at a local market. The Emirates does, however, have several drug rehabilitation centres. Although Major Fardan does not admit to a drug abuse problem in the Emirates, his remarks, in a talk to Zayed University students reported by Gulf News yesterday, highlighted concern that the rich -and often bored - Emirates youngsters could be at risk. He warned that parents should not allow their children to travel alone to countries where drugs are sold openly, or which are known to have \"addiction dens\". Once again, we have a story with a curious lack of detail: absolutely no information (such as names or ages) is given about either the victim or the perpetrators, and the location where this crime supposedly took place is suspiciously vague (\"a Gulf state\"). And how was this \"crime\" revealed to the world? Not in a government or police press conference, but \"in a talk to university students\" by the \"head of the drugs squad.\" If you're a government official tasked with keeping a handle on your country's drug problems, what better way to call attention to the issue than by relating a horrific story about the depravity of foreign drug traffickers to a hall full of college students? It serves as a warning about the perils of drug use, it blames the problem on evil foreigners, and it garners terrific press coverage — even if it is merely a bit of fiction. The next time someone tries to pass off this legend as an actual occurrence, the media would do well to heed the experience of Miami Herald crime reporter Edna Buchana before running the item as a news story: The stories about drugs in Miami are also larger than life. So many are true that even the myth of the dead baby has become accepted as modern Miami-American folklore.Let's get this straight right here and now: There is no cocaine-stuffed dead baby, at least at this writing. The dead baby resurfaces frequently, reported as fact in otherwise responsible and prestigious — and some not so responsible and prestigious — publications. It has appeared on the front page of The Washington Post, in Life magazine, and in the National Enquirer. The story, with minor variations, is that an alert customs official or airline employee on a Colombia-Miami flight noticed that a baby in the arms of a woman passenger did not look well. Closer scrutiny revealed that the baby was dead and its body stuffed with high-grade cocaine in an attempt to smuggle the drug into this country. The dead baby is reported at least once a year. Each time, I am one of the many reporters assigned to check it out. It is fiction. It did not happen. I have laid the dead baby to rest so often that I can now see its poor little pasty face in my mind's eye.

"Barbara Mikkelson" 2000-04-14 "Workers at the Corona brewery urinate into the beer." "Claim: Workers at the Corona brewery urinate into the beer. FALSE Origins: Although in business one always at least somewhat suspects jealous competitors of starting whichever wild slander is hot at the moment, the \"piss in the Corona beer\" whisper campaign stands almost unique in that it's one of the few cases on record where this connection was traced to its source.  Corona is a light lager often drunk with a lime. In 1925 Grupo Modelo S.A. de C.V was founded in Mexico by Pablo Diez Fernandez. Its flagship brew, Corona, became a national brand, and the brewery went on to acquire regional beers like Pacifico, Victoria and Leon. Corona was first exported in the late 1970s. By 1986 Corona ranked second in the United States in imported beers (Heineken led the way). Then along came 1987. That year, the company first learned of \"urine in the beer\" slur being attributed to its flagship product when two Nevada grocers pulled the beer from their shelves. According to rumor, Mexican brewery workers were relieving themselves into the beer destined to be sold in the U.S.A. Sales were dropping precipitously, so the maligned brewer set about to find the source of the slander and put an end to the rumor. Against the odds, they were successful with the first task — the source of the rumor was traced. A local Heineken distributor (Luce & Sons of Reno) was sued by Corona's U.S. handlers, Barton Beers Ltd. The suit was dropped when Luce agreed to say publicly that Corona was not contaminated. The second task — putting the rumor to rest — proved to be more difficult. The slander spread across the nation. Corona bombarded the press with news releases about the hoax and spent $500,000 beaming a public education program via satellite to TV stations willing to run it. Executives appeared on 20 talk shows in three weeks. Corona has rebuilt its market share over the years and in 1999 in the United States was the best-selling import and the 10th best-selling beer overall. Why the slander worked as well as it did has as much to do with the nature of beer itself as with xenophobic fears about anything coming in from Mexico. (Folklorist Gary Fine says, \"Americans see Mexico as both an underdeveloped nation — an exotic location filled with danger and poverty — and recently as an economic rival.\") Getting back to the beer aspects, among suds drinkers a common insult to hurl at a disappointing brew is to claim it \"tastes like warm piss.\" (How these aficionados would know what warm piss tastes like doesn't bear speculating upon.) The connection between beer and urine is twofold: the color of both liquids, plus the causal relationship between the drinking of one to the need to release the other. In Corona's case, believability is further enhanced by the foaminess of the beverage and how the clear glass bottles showcase the beer's yellow color. All beer may be yellow, but only Corona visually reminds buyers of this fact even as it passively sits in the bottle. Though the slander generally adheres only to Corona, its theme is jokingly referred to in other bits of popular lore. A long-circulated bit of xeroxlore shows a horse drinking out of a bucket labelled \"Coors\" and simultaneously pissing into one marked \"Budweiser\". Such snippets lack the malice of the Corona rumor in that they are framed in such a way no one could take them seriously and are thus clearly intended as humor. By contrast, the rumor about Corona was not presented in a joking fashion — it was an effective slander passed in whispered tones into cupped ears. Barbara \"at lagerheads with the competition\" Mikkelson Sightings: One of the plot threads in an episode of L.A. Law (\"Urine Trouble Now,\" original air date 11 May 1989) has the law firm defending a Mexican brewery being maligned by a 'urine in beer' rumor spread by one of its Anglo competitors.

"Barbara Mikkelson" 2000-04-06 "Women are being lured out of malls and into dangerous situations with the promise of appearing in television commericals." "Claim: Women are being lured out of malls and into dangerous situations with the promise of appearing in television commericals. Status: False. Example: [Collected on the Internet, 1998]  Last night on Inside Edition there was an article that is of interest to all women. There is a new scam to abduct women. A man comes up to a women in a Mall or Shopping Center and asks if she likes Pizza, when she says she does he offers her a $100.00 to shoot a commercial for Pizza, but they need to go outside where the lighting is better, when the woman goes out of the mall she is abducted and assaulted. Another ploy is a very nicely dressed man asks a woman if she would be in a Public Service Announcement to discourage drug use. The man explains that they don't want professional actors or celebrities they want the average mother to do this. Once she leaves the mall she is a victim. The third ploy, a very frantic man comes running in and asks a woman to please help him, his baby is not breathing. She runs out of the mall following him and is also a victim. This has been happening in well lit parking areas in daylight as well as nighttime and the abductor usually uses a Van to abduct the woman. Inside Edition set up a test in a Mall and 10 out of 15 women went out of the Mall on the Pizza scam and the Drug scam. Please pass this along to your friends and family as now that it has been shown on nationwide TV there are bound to be copy cats of this.
 Origins: This scare began circulating on the Internet in August 1998. There's no reason to worry unduly about clipboard-wielding strangers encountered at the local shopping mall — reports of abductions of this nature are not surfacing in the news, and it's clear women are not being kidnapped wholesale from malls by way of these ploys. Inside Edition did air a segment very much as described, on 8 August 1998. However the point of the episode was not to report that an epidemic of such abductions were taking place; just that it was possible to persuade women to follow a stranger out of a mall and into a van. Inside Edition host Don Criqui's intro for the piece went as follows: In an earlier report, we showed you how even the most carefully taught child can fall prey to someone trying to lure them away. Half the kids fell for our safety expert's trick. But did you ever think that you could be fooled? In another of our safety reports, Janet Tamaro tells us that even adults can fall victim to a dangerous lure. Showing that something can happen is not the same as reporting that it is happening. That's an important point; one that should be kept firmly in mind. Inside Edition's efforts at capturing women were successful: in the space of three hours, their safety expert did manage to lure 10 of the 15 women he approached out of the mall and into a van parked in an alleyway by using the pizza commercial and public service announcement ploys outlined above. As part of the piece, Tamaro interviewed a 24-year-old woman who claimed in 1994 to have been lured off the street (not from a shopping mall) and into a parked van, then assaulted by a man who said his baby was gasping for breath. Such a report makes it appear there might be some basis for concern, but an astute viewer would then ask himself, \"If the situation is epidemic, why are they using a four-year-old incident as their only example?\" It is possible there have been one or two such abductions over the years, but even so, nothing on a scale to support a level of hysteria called for in the e-mailed warning. Despite the claim of this being \"a new scam to abduct women,\" kidnappings by deception are neither the norm nor on the increase. Abductions from malls do happen, but they are mostly (if not entirely) of the old-fashioned variety: point a gun at someone's head, place a knife at the victim's throat, or pull her into a car. Lethal weapons and force, not guile, remain the tools of choice. It's easy to see how the author of this e-mail misunderstood Inside Edition's piece — this tabloid news show did not go to great lengths to present information fairly. In closing, Criqui quoted the safety expert used in the segment: \"There are between 200 and 300 known criminal abductions every year. In more than half of those cases the victim and the abductor were complete strangers to each other.\" That could easily lead someone to believe that 100 to 150 women a year are falling for the pizza commericial scam, not that violent abductions from everywhere (not just malls) are running at this rate. Inside Edition is not the most reliable of sources. The show's raison d'etre is to garner a viewership by sensationalism. In this case, the line between \"could happen\" and \"is happening\" was intentionally blurred to make a more watchable piece. In March 2000, this bit of e-lore was kickstarted back in action by a JC Penney employee who thoughtlessly forwarded the e-mail. Those further down the line interpreted that person's .sigblock as official imprimatur from a JC Penney spokesperson, with the implication that such abductions were taking place in and around malls housing that retailer. Dismiss this scare as being born of a tabloid news show's desire to titillate its viewers. Women just aren't being grabbed in this fashion, and it doesn't matter how many \"gullibility tests\" shows like this air. The problem is not real. It does pay to be careful around strangers, but this doesn't have to be taken to extremes, and an e-mailed warning shouldn't persuade you to stay at home behind locked doors. A normal and prudent level of caution that still leaves interaction with others possible can be maintained. In other words, you can talk to strangers, just don't follow them into vans. And don't believe everything you see on tabloid news shows. Barbara \"petrified doris\" Mikkelson Additional information:  Last updated: 10 October 2006

Burger Kings are now building their play area's inside the buildings for more safe environment.
 Variations:
   Origins: Despite their benign appearance, children's indoor plastic ball pits often pose health and safety hazards. Those who clean these play areas report finding everything from used syringes to dirty diapers in them. Before letting your child loose in one,
make sure the play area's maintenance staff spot clean the pit once a day and wash all the balls every week. Diapers come off in ball pits, and half-eaten candy is routinely found in there. More disturbingly, syringes and knives have turned up in there. Yes, ball pits have their dangers. But snakes aren't one of them. That part is pure lore. (A made-up cyber story about a child who supposedly died after being pricked by a heroin-filled needle found in a ball pit is also nothing but lore. Our Kevin Archer page gives details about this particular tale.) People have been reporting hearing the 'snakes in the ball pit' tale since at least the mid-1990s. It's a horrific tale of a parental nightmare — one wants to believe there are at least some places a child would be safe in. If not a supervised play area, then where? Though this legend has gotten around, there are no real life incidents that correspond to it. No children have been bitten by venomous snakes lurking in ball pits. Though injuries and one death have occurred in such play areas, none were snake-related. It's no wonder: A ball pit is one of the last places an animal such as a rattlesnake would choose for a residence. Just as we dislike snakes, they  likewise don't much care for us. A rattler will avoid people and inhabited areas whenever possible. As well, snakes are cold-blooded and depend upon their environment to regulate their temperature. Therefore, they seek out places that will keep them warm when the weather is cool, and vice-versa. Snakes tend to burrow under things like rocks and sheets of metal that provide shade when the weather is hot and offer surfaces for basking in absorbed or reflected heat when the weather is cooler. The bottom of a ball pit doesn't see the light of day and thus is much too cold and damp an environment for a rattlesnake. Also, snakes do not live in \"families.\" The female rattlesnake gives birth in a nest and continues on her way — she doesn't wait around to make sure the young ones are all right, nor does she attempt to care for her offspring in any way. With no parents to take care of them, the newborn snakes have no reason to remain together as a family unit. Their number one priority is to scatter in search of food, not huddle with one another. (It's a neat folkloric juxtaposition, though — the \"evil\" family of snakes destroys the \"good\" family of humans.) This legend of a child's fatally encountering a venomous snake in an amusement area is closely related to a similar tale about a wooden carousel horse. A little girl rides the merry-go-round to her death as her mother discovers all too late the painted hollow steed was home to a nest of vipers that bit her daughter throughout the ride. Similar tales abound of snakes nesting in roller coaster cars just unhoused from winter storage and bad-tempered venomous vipers fanging any hand carelessly trailed in the water of an amusement park's Tunnel of Love. The message is clear: danger lurks amidst the gaiety, and a wise parent never takes his eyes off his kid. The juxtaposition of venomous snakes and amusement areas makes an even stronger statement than if these selfsame snakes were putting the chomp on youngsters in less carnival-like settings — say, a schoolyard or a department store. Such legends work to caution parents to not relax parental vigilance even in presumed safe settings. Barbara \"bawl pit\" Mikkelson Additional information:    Last updated: 7 August 2007

"Barbara Mikkelson" 2000-03-17 "A 13-year-old boy in Thailand died from pumping air up his rectum to get high." "A Thai teenager died from a punctured intestine brought about by compressed air being forced into his rectum. The death was not part of a \"fad\" for getting high, but rather the result of a prank perpetrated upon the victim by others that went wrong. Originally making the cyberspace rounds in mid-1997, a fancifully-embellished cautionary tale has been enshrined as one of the Internet's \"Darwin Awards.\" Though the story was often identified as an article from the 15 August 1993 Japan Times, we found no evidence that news outlet ever published it: \"The government must crack down on this disgusting craze of Pumping\", a spokesman for the Nakhon Ratchasima hospital told reporters. \"If this perversion catches on, it will destroy the cream of Thailand's manhood.\" He was speaking after the remains of 13-year-old Charnchai Puanmuangpak had been rushed into the hospital's emergency room. \"Most 'Pumpers' use a standard bicycle pump,\" he explained, \"inserting the nozzle far up their rectum, giving themselves a rush of air, creating a momentary high. This act is a sin against God.\" Charnchai took it further still. He started using a two-cylinder foot pump, but even that wasn't exciting enough for him, and he boasted to friends that he was going to try the compressed air hose at a nearby gasoline station. They dared him to do it so, under cover of darkness, he snuck in. Not realising how powerful the machine was, he inserted the tube deep into his rectum, and placed a coin in the slot. As a result, he died virtually instantly, but passers by are still in shock. One woman thought she was watching a twilight firework display, and started clapping. \"We still haven't located all of him,\" say the police authorities. \"When that quantity of air interacted with the gas in his system, he nearly exploded. It was like an atom bomb went off or something.\" \"Pumping is the devil's pastime, and we must all say no to Satan,\" Ratchasima concluded. \"Inflate your tires by all means, but then hide your bicycle pump where it cannot tempt you.\" As humorous as this bit of scarelore was, it fell down upon closer examination for multiple reasons:      The tone of indignant moral outrage is common to such offerings; it works to highlight the humor of the situation as we find ourselves laughing even as the ubiquitous cartoonish \"spokesman\" heatedly expounds upon the latest threat to Society. We're also captured by the obligatory mental picture of the lad's inglorious yet pyrotechnic end. (\"One woman thought she was watching a twilight firework display, and started clapping.\") As unbelievable as this story is, it appears to be a fanciful embellishment of the 1993 death of Charnchai Puanmuangpak of Thailand. Though the 13-year-old did die from a punctured intestine brought about by compressed air being forced into his rectum, he was killed by others; there was no element of a death brought about by self-gratification gone wrong. The real Charnchai Puanmuangpak died when two of his 15-year-old co-workers at the gas station carried a prank too far. These older lads were in the habit of turning the compressed air upon Charnchai when they found him napping. Finding him deeply asleep, this time they inserted the nozzle into his bum. The boy died before reaching the hospital, and the two lads who inserted the hose were charged with carelessness resulting in death. A similar act of battery carried out upon a 13-year-old boy in Dezhou city (Shandong province), China, on 30 June 2012 left the unfortunate teen barely clinging to life. Two of Du Chuanwang's co-workers at the gas station where they all worked inserted the nozzle of an air pump hose into the youngster's anus then blew air through it, in the process damaging Du's liver, kidneys, and stomach and causing massive bleeding within the abdomen. Following a charity appeal, the boy was moved from a local hospital (Xiajin County People's Hospital) to the far better equipped Bayi Children's Hospital in Beijing." 2000 "Mar" 3 1990

"Barbara Mikkelson" 2000-03-16 "A Virginia man was washing machined to death." "Claim: A Virginia man was washing machined to death. Status: False. Example: [Collected on the Internet, 1999]  CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (Nov. 13) — A 39-year-old Charlottesville man died Thursday in a freak accident involving his washing machine. According to police reports,Samuel Randolph Strickson was doing laundry when he tried to speed up the process. Strickson apparently tried to stuff approximately 50 pounds of laundry into his washing machine by climbing on top of the washer and attempting to force the clothing into the basin. Strickson then apparently accidentally kicked the washing machine's ON button. When the machine turned on, Strickson lost his balance and both feet went down into the machine, where they got stuck. The machine started its cycle, and Strickson, unable to free himself, started thrashing around as the machine's agitator went into gear. Strickson's head banged against a nearby shelf the laundry room, knocking over a bottle of bleach, which poured over Strickson's face, blinding him. Forensic reports say Strickson apparently also swallowed some of the bleach. He then vomited, but was still unable to free himself. Strickson's dog then apparently came into the laundry room. At about the same time, according to police, a large box of baking soda fell from the shelf, startling the dog, which then urinated. Urine, like vinegar, is acidic, and the chemical reaction between the urine and the baking soda resulted in \"a small explosion,\" according to police reports. The dog, however, escaped unharmed. Strickson remained stuck in the washing machine, which eventually went into its high-speed spin cycle, spinning Strickson around at about 70 miles per hour, according to forensic experts. Strickson's head then smashed against a steel beam behind the washing machine, immediately killing him. A neighbor heard the commotion and called 911, but Strickson, a 1998 graduate of Virginia Tech, was pronounced dead at the scene.
 Origins: Yet another fanciful \"Darwin Award\" nominee e-mail is on the loose. It first appeared in December 1998, but we predict it will be with us for a long time to come. Why? Because it involves guys and  washing machines, two critters you just know are going to have to go at it to the death. We'd love to tell you all the reported facts check out, but that would be lying. There's no record of anyone expiring in this fashion, in Virginia or elsewhere. Moreover, the story is wildy implausible, bordering on impossible. We'll leave it to the science types to explain why mixing baking soda with urine would not cause an explosion (combining vinegar with baking soda merely results in foam) and just concentrate on the claims made about the washing machine itself. Most units in use in the United States are of the top-loading variety and come equipped with a brake that stops the spinning tub when the lid is lifted. (Some even lock the lid during the spin cycle, making it impossible to open the lid for about 45 seconds after the tub has stopped.) Even if the
control that turns the machine on had accidentally been twisted, flipped, or pulled into the 'ON' position, the brake would have kept the machine from starting as long as the lid was up. We don't doubt anyone stupid enough to try to force 50 lbs. of laundry into a washing machine would be capable of getting his feet tangled in the works. We do, however, doubt anything he did while in that position would cause the overwhelming majority of washers to engage. Even in the case of the rare top-loader that can continue to agitate clothes with its lid up, the controls on every washing machine would be easily accessible to a dupe so trapped. The original version of this bit of Internet lore made no mention of the victim being \"a 1998 graduate of Virginia Tech.\" We're guessing someone from University of Virginia added that detail for additional humorous effect. Rivalry between those two schools is long-standing, as is the penchant for students from each to make denigrating jokes about those who attend the other institution. This is yet another of those \"helpless male\" stories in which a man unwilling to master the basics of housework takes a sledgehammer approach to a simple domestic chore. We laugh at the image of the fellow losing his life in a laundry room tragedy because he fits the stereotype we've grown comfortable with, that men attempting to use household appliances are a danger to themselves and others. Stupidity has its price, says this tale. Barbara \"wash 'n' weregeld\" Mikkelson Last updated: 19 January 2007

 Origins: This snippet of e-lore debuted on the Internet in December 1999. It speaks directly to the fears of the lone female business traveler, thus accounting for its popularity. Those who don't do a great deal of traveling themselves easily have a number of female friends who do. In 1970, female business travelers were rare birds indeed. Only 1% of road warriors were female. In those not-so-long-ago days, well-dressed women traveling on behalf of their companies were sometimes mistaken for prostitutes, both by hotel security and other guests. A lot has changed. Today, more than 40% of business travelers are women, and by 2002 that figure is expected to rise to 50%. Though she still greatly prefers to take meals in her room (at least twice as many women as men traveling on business will order from room service), she's a lot less likely to be mistaken for a lady of the evening these days. In terms of debunking this particular account, there's not much that can be done — dates aren't given, the hotel and city aren't named, and though we (supposedly) have the name of the woman who wrote this missive, without also knowing what company she works for, finding her would be impossible. There is thus no point in asking if it's true — not enough information is provided to call it one way or the other. Experience in dealing with scarelore, however, indicates the above is merely good advice worked into the form of a cautionary tale. \"When traveling alone, don't sign your name on room service orders\" is not the kind of message to be retained in people's minds; it just won't stick. Work the finger-wagging into a scary story about a woman who failed to follow this advice and thus barely escaped God-knows-what horrible fate, and the tale's underlying admonition is branded into memory. The tale tends to fail the plausibility test on a \"key\" point. Hotels say they will not hand out room keys to just anyone, no matter what relationship that person claims to have to the room's occupant. Especially in the case of one spouse looking for the other, only a fool of a hotel staffer is going to give out a key, no matter what the sob story. The married have too often used hotels to hunker down with someone other than their lawful spouse for any hotelier to presume that a lady who checked in by herself is necessarily sleeping alone. When an unexpected visitor — husband or otherwise — presents himself at the front desk, standard procedure requires a call be placed to the registered guest. Not even the room number is given out at this point. Only once the guest has given the okay will the visitor either be directed to wait in the lobby for the guest to come fetch him or provided with the room number and directed to the correct bank of elevators to take him to that floor. Under no circumstances are keys given out to anyone not listed in the registration for that room. Even those who've checked in together should not expect be given replacement keys if they lose theirs and are not noted as one of the room's occupants. Even in the case of properly registered guests, the front desk will demand to see a photo I.D. before issuing a new key. That is the recommended (indeed, pounded into the heads) procedure, but how this plays out in real life can sometimes stray wildly from the script. Easily-cowed desk clerks can be pressured by insistent \"guests\" who keeps demanding the key to \"their\" rooms. The number of fool desk clerks who can be counted on to surrender up the key without first seeing proper ID from the registered guest is small, though, so the likelihood of an invader using this highly unreliable method is remote. Hotel invaders do exist, but their most effective means of gaining entrance to a victim's hotel room is to simply knock on the door and announce themselves as being from room service or maintenance. (Not surprisingly, even the savvy traveler will often unthinkingly open the door to a stranger under those circumstances.) First presenting themselves to the front desk, thus affording hotel staff to get a good look at them, doesn't fit the basic rule of break-in artists everywhere of not calling undue attention to themselves. Dead-bolting the door upon retiring is always a good idea — who knows but that the happy drunk staying down the hall will return to the floor three sheets to the wind at some ungodly hour and by happenstance his key will work on the door he soddenly remembers as being his but which is in reality yours. More likely, one fails to put out the \"Do Not Disturb\" sign — without the bolt being on the door, the maids are likely to barge in while you're in the shower the next morning. Those who continue to be very worried about the possibility of someone breaking in while they're there should consider buying a screamer, a device hooked to the door handle which will go off if anyone tries to open the door. Some hotels do provide \"hang on door\" breakfast menus which allow the room's occupant to check off desired items and indicate when the meal should be delivered. Such an arrangement can be a real timesaver, as anyone who has ordered breakfast from room service then sat around for an hour waiting for it can attest to. These menus usually have to be on doorknobs by a stated time (often 2 am). It's rarely necessary to list the guest's name on them — the order and a room number will suffice. Even if a name is called for, a surname only will do. All of the preceding is not to say that travelers (especially women) shouldn't take certain precautions to foil thieves and invaders or that the dangers hinted at in \"Laura Wilson's\" account aren't real. You should, and they are. But do these cautions really need to be expressed in the form of a \"This happened to me!!!\" e-mail to drive them home? Or can we for once do away with the bodice-ripper writing style and cut straight through to what needs to be said: how to safeguard yourself when traveling? Safety Tips For All:
  Names trumpeted too loudly afford the room invader with a made-to-order scenario for gaining access to an occupied room. A call to the hotel operator asking to be connected to Ms. So-and-So's room followed by a conversation with the lady herself during which the caller identifies himself as a handyman in need of repairing some item in her room can lead to an ugly chain of events. Always call the department in question to make sure they are sending someone before taking such a caller at his word.      Barbara \"sent of a woman\" Mikkelson Last updated: 28 July 2006

"Barbara Mikkelson" 1999-12-17 "A leper was found working in a Chesterfield cigarette factory." "Claim: A leper was found working in a Chesterfield cigarette factory.  <!--
Example: [Collected via e-mail, April 2009]   -->
Origins: In 1934 a particularly vicious rumor campaign aimed at disrupting sales of Chesterfield cigarettes went into effect. Up and down the Atlantic seaboard, then all across the U.S., the whispered tale was heard: \"A leper has been found working  in the Chesterfield cigarette factory in Richmond, Virginia.\" Fear of contracting leprosy through smoking product handled by a leper kept customers at bay. Liggett and Myers (the tobacco company which produced Chesterfields, among other brands), fought back by getting the mayor and the Board of Health of Richmond to issue an official statement that Chesterfield factories had been investigated and nothing had been found to support this rumor. The city officials said they could \"state with authority the malicious, malignant, underhanded and unfounded rumors pertaining to public health now being circulated ... are without the slightest foundation in fact and are lies made from whole cloth.\" The announcement did little to slow the spread of the rumor. Like the work of the broom-wielding sweeper who follows the elephant, denials — even ones issuing from disinterested official sources — don't change the impression left by what the elephant dropped. Liggett and Myers also offered $1,000 rewards to the first 25 people who furnished them with satisfactory evidence as to who was spreading this tale. Though the company proved unsuccessful in tracing the story to its source, they did determine that the rumor appeared to be the work of professional rumormongers hired by
their business competitors. Rumors about contaminated workers and cigarette factories had been around before becoming attached to Chesterfield; Liggett and Myers were merely the latest stop on this wandering leper of lore's schedule. The company tried to duke it out with whoever was behind these tales, but that proved an exercise in boxing at
shadows. Their statement that \"We do not object to legitimate competition, but cowardly attacks of this sort have no place in American business or American life\" fell on unlistening ears. The leper rumor wasn't the only image attack Liggett and Myers had to do battle with. Around the same time the \"leper\" rumor was circulating, the firm was combating false whispers that it had contributed more than half a million dollars to Adolf Hitler. They'd done no such thing, but the angered reaction raised in those who heard this rumor ran unchecked. Fear needs an outlet, and this rumor gave those concerned about Hitler's growing power a target for their apprehension: The untruth about Chesterfield's contributing to aid the Nazis at a time when many people lived in constant dread of Hitler's triumphs not only aroused a desire for revenge which resulted in fall-off of sales, but gave the gullible dupe personal satisfaction by providing him with a means for venting his own inner emotions. Condemning Chesterfield makers, spreading the rumor, and no longer buying the cigarettes became as pleasurable to the credulous as loosening the laces of a tight shoe or unfastening a belt buckle after a heavy dinner. It now became possible to manifest hatred for nazism, to take action against a frightening enemy by moving against an individual commercial group. The opportunity was far too delicious for the frustrated to pause and make conscious inquiries into the matter of fact and truth. Times change, but human nature doesn't. The same urge to strike a blow at a large evil by delivering one on the chin to a corporation reputed to be in league with it also drove a rumor about Procter & Gamble as well as a whole host of false claims about Osama bin Laden's business holdings in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Those looking to stand up for their country or take a whack at Satanism are oddly comforted by using large companies as their personal punching bags. That the rumors are baseless doesn't matter; having a target to direct outrage at does. Barbara \"deviled by a rumor\" Mikkelson Last updated: 9 May 2009

"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/coat-of-armed/" "legend" "You never know when you may come across your worst fears." "Barbara Mikkelson" 1999-12-03 "A woman was fatally bitten by a snake found in the pocket of her new winter coat." "The tale of the deadly snake lurking in consumer goods dates to at least the mid 1960s. As a snippet of popular lore, it combined two familiar elements: distrust of business establishments, and dangerous foreign creatures encountered in unexpected places. Examples: Recently, when visiting my parents in NJ, my elderly aunt told me that her neighbor's visiting nurse told her that another patient of hers was recovering from a snakebite. This woman had gone to a large clothing outlet type store and tried on a coat. After experiencing swelling and discomfort in her shoulder, went to the doctor who pronounced her the victim of an unknown snake. She returned to the store, found the same coat she had tried on and the store manager discovered two baby snakes still in residence in the coat. The woman had recovered and of course was suing the store.  Several summers ago a housewife in New York suffered a very unfortunate accident while out shopping. It transpired that she had gone into a large department store to look for a wicker clothes-basket with a lid. As she looked through the baskets she kept putting her hand inside the lid and running her fingers round the rim to check that they did not have any loose canes that would snag the clothes as they were pushed in and pulled out. While going through this procedure, all of a sudden, she gave a cry and fell to the floor. She was immediately rushed to hospital but found to be dead on arrival. On examination it was discovered that she had died as a result of a snake bite. When the baskets were checked they found a large and deadly poisonous snake in the bottom of the one she was seen to examine last. It was concluded that the snake had arrived in America having been shipped in the basket from the Far East. Variations:
    By 1991, a legend that had begun in the late 1960s as a \"snake hidden in most anything\" tale had polarized into a \"viper in a winter coat\" tale. Moreover, by that time the legend had come to be strongly associated with Burlington Coat Factory, a New Jersey firm with stores across the U.S.A. Though many clothiers manufacture outerwear, and winter coats are offered for sale in most clothing stores, Burlington Coat Factory is one of the few to specialize almost exclusively in this item of apparel. Consequently, any legend involving a winter coat will naturally gravitate towards that firm. The impression that coats are less expensive at Burlington adds to the believability of the legend — to sell them on the cheap, popular wisdom dictates that Burlington must be importing its inventory from third world countries just a'slithering with venomous snakes. Burlington says its been looking for that mythical snake for years and is constantly being asked about it. According to its people, the story could never come true in that chain — coats don't get to the consumer fast enough for any lurking snakes (assuming there were any) to still be part of the deal. \"If a snake is in there, it's got to sit in a distribution center for a few months before it's sent to the stores. Are you going to tell me, it survived all that time up a sleeve?\" said Ric Bramble, Burlington Coat Factory spokesman at the chain's headquarters in Burlington. Venomous spiders have, upon occasion, turned up in the produce section of grocery stores (often amongst the grapes). Contrary to legend, they don't pop up in dry goods or in clothing departments. Snake sightings in retail establishments are even more rare, but a 1991 lawsuit asserted that one slithered into a Pennsylvania couple's mattress. Shortly after purchasing the mattress in May 1988, the couple noted unusual movements in the bed that they suspected could be a living creature. They exchanged the mattress for another, but again noted those same odd movements in their bed. After four months of this, they took the mattress to a lab, where workers found what was left of a 26-inch ribbon snake. The couple asked for $20,000 in damages. In September 2003, Douglas Hatchett of Bangs, Texas, while shopping for shoes in a Wal-Mart, claimed to have been bit by a rattlesnake which had been concealed behind a shoebox on a shelf. The victim said he stomped the snake to death, and the man was treated and released the same day from an area hospital. Doubt has since been expressed as to the veracity of his claim, with the hospital asserting Hatchett was not bitten by the snake and that their services were stolen by him. Wal-Mart as well is questioning the validity of Hatchett's story, and police at the scene said to a Wal-Mart employee the dead Western Diamondback rattler didn't look like a freshly killed snake. Key to understanding the legend is appreciating that the fatal coat is never purchased from an upscale shop. The common perception of discount stores' trading off quality for price enters into this legend, as does an element of the overly frugal shopper getting her just deserts. Had she only been willing to pay retail, we nod sagely to ourselves, she'd have lived. Most of all, however, this tale speaks to our fear of foreign contamination. The snake in this legend always comes from outside the U.S.A., even though America also has both venomous vipers and a textile industry. Just as in the Mexican Pet and the spider-filled shaking cactus legends, something brought in from a foreign land conceals untold dangers." 1999 "Dec" 12 1980

"David Mikkelson" 1999-11-28 "John Wayne's autopsy revealed 40 pounds of impacted fecal matter lodged in his colon." "Claim: John Wayne's autopsy revealed 40 pounds of impacted fecal matter lodged in his colon. Status: False. Examples:  By the way when they did an autopsy on John Wayne (Mr. Macho himself) 40 pounds of impacted fecal matter was removed from his death inducing cancerous colon. That's because Humans are not evolved for Animal eating. Animal fats lodge in the folds and pockets of our intestines. Carnivores have smooth intestinal linings and do not have these problems.
 
 [Hainer, 1999] It's said that, according to the autopsy, John Wayne had 40 pounds of impacted fecal matter in his body at death. Elvis reportedly had 60 pounds.
 Origins: Advocates of colonic irrigation products of dubious benefit use scarelore like the examples quoted above to indict the American \"goo and glue\" diet and validate their claim that the practice is a safe and effective means of curing a variety of ailments by purging the body of all sorts of sludge and toxins. Vegetarian groups employ this horror story to demonstrate that a meat-based diet is both unnatural and unhealthy for human beings. Hence stories circulate about alleged post-mortem discoveries that celebrities (such as John Wayne and Elvis Presley) who epitomized the \"meat and potatoes\" diet, gluttony, or other negative eating habits had some tremendous amount (40, 60, or even 80 pounds) of \"impacted fecal matter\" or \"impacted feces\" lodged in their intestines. Anecdotes such as these are, in a word, crap. It is possible for fecal matter to become impacted and lodge in the digestive system. In most cases, the colon tissues eventually stretch so that stool can push its way around the impacted matter and be evacuated. If this condition continues too long, however, the colon can stretch to the point that its nerves are no longer capable of receiving signals effectively, and the afflicted person loses voluntary control over the contraction of his bowel muscles and becomes incontinent. Now, think about how long a person would have to suffer with a serious and painful affliction such as this one to accumulate 80 pounds (or 60 pounds or 40 pounds) of \"impacted fecal matter.\" In 1994, an Israeli man sought medical attention because he was suffering from severe constipation two days after having eaten a large quantity of pomegranates. He refused to allow doctors to adminster an enema, fled the hospital, and returned a week later in severe pain and bleeding from his rectum. This time the doctors operated to remove the impacted feces. How much fecal matter did they remove? Half a kilogram, or a little over a pound. Just one pound of impacted feces was causing extreme pain and rectal bleeding in this patient, but we're to believe that people can accumulate up to 80 pounds of the stuff without even being aware of it? No matter what the medical possibilities might be, the prototypical John Wayne example is still a demonstrable lie: No autopsy was performed on John Wayne when he succumbed to cancer in 1979. The medical examiner's office had no reason to hold an autopsy since Wayne had obviously died from natural causes, and hospital pathologists had little to learn by requesting the autopsy of a cancer patient who had already undergone several major surgeries (and Wayne's family would have denied such a request in any case). In fact, Wayne's relatives were so intent on fending off a crush of media and fan attention after his death that they hired a security guard to block access to his hospital room, had his body quickly and secretly transferred to a mortuary, held a funeral service attended only by family and a few friends at 5:45 in the morning, and had him interred in a plot without a headstone. Nobody had the chance to perform an autopsy on John Wayne, much less to \"run his gut\" and weigh the amount of fecal material found within. (Wayne did undergo surgery for an intestinal blockage about a month before his death, but that blockage was caused by the spread of the cancer that was killing him, not by an accumulation of waste products.) This claim was somewhat true about Elvis Presley (in concept if not in actual quantity), but not for the reasons we're led to believe. According to an account based on the report by the four doctors who performed the post-mortem examination of the entertainer: The colon is approximately five to seven feet in length in a person Elvis's size and should have been about two inches in diameter ... however, Elvis's colon was at least three and a half inches in diameter in some places and as large as four and half to five inches in diameter in others ... [T]he megacolon was jam-packed from the base of the descending colon all the way up and halfway across the transverse colon. It was filled with white, chalklike fecal material. This account makes it sound like Elvis was a prime example of the hazards of the \"goo and glue\" diet, but his poor eating habits (greasy, cholesterol-laden foods such as cheeseburgers, french fries, bacon, fried peanut butter and banana sandwiches, ice cream) were far less responsible for the condition of his colon than other factors, such as his congenitally twisted ganglionic fold, his overuse of laxatives, and, primarily, his prolonged drug abuse. As one of the autopsy doctors described, \"When you take downer-type drugs, depressants, narcotics, a lot of them, most of them, have the concomitant effect of slowing down the digestive system. In other words, the locomotive action of the bowel quits working, so it gets packed with food, and then it gets packed with more food. And it sits there distended and full of food, and that causes the colon to stretch.\" In other words, it was drugs, not meat, that caused the severely impacted condition of Elvis' colon. None of this is to say that treatments such as colonic irrigation have absolutely no therapeutic value, or that most of us wouldn't do well to change our diets to cut down (or possibly eliminate) our intake of meat, or that the morality of killing animals for food is not open to debate. The point is, however, that no one soberly considering these issues should allow himself to be influenced by the type of propagandistic misinformation contained in Internet anecdotes such as these.

"Claim: Thieves lie in wait under victims' cars, then render their victims helpless by slashing their ankles.  Examples:  I was told not to go shopping at the Tacoma mall because women were being robbed there by men hiding under their cars. The woman would come back to her car all laden down with packages, and when she was standing there trying to open the door, a guy hiding underneath her car would slash her ankle with a razor so she couldn't get away, then take her purse and packages and drive off in her car.
 
 [Collected on the Internet, 1999] It was said that teenage punks or gangsters would hide underneath your car in a parking lot and then slash your ankles before you got into the driver's seat. Then as you reach down at your ankles in reaction to the pain, they would slash your wrists to disarm you. They then proceed to either rape or murder you, or steal your car, depending on which version you hear.

cars sit low to the ground, making it darned near impossible for anyone to hide under them yet still retain enough freedom of movement to both slash the driver's ankle and get out from under the vehicle to complete the robbery before the victim's cries draw assistance. Moreover, if an assailant is looking for a place to conceal himself, why not crouch behind the car (or maybe even within it)? Robberies, rapes, and abductions have taken place in shopping mall parking lots, but until November 2008 in none were the assailants lying in wait underneath the victim's vehicle. (In that assault, a woman in Salt Lake City was raped at knife-point by a man who had hidden beneath a car.) (See our Shopping Mauled page for a related legend about bad guys lurking in parking lots and at gas stations to prey upon women.) Folklorist Jan Brunvand traces the first sighting of this legend to sometime in the 1950s to the Northland Shopping Mall in Detroit, MI. At various times, different cities have since experienced \"slasher scares\" in which these villains of lore were rumored to be lurking under cars at local shopping centers:  Police departments in numerous locales have tried to squelch the rumor, with varying degrees of success. In 1991, when the tale was all the rage in Chicago, the police there established a hot line to give those concerned about what they'd heard a place to call and get the facts. Within the first four days, over 400 calls had been logged to that number. It wouldn't be a proper bit of scarelore if Dear Abby didn't get in on the act somewhere. Which she did in 1992: Dear Abby: I am 16 and am terrified to go to the mall. At our local shopping mall, crimes have been going on that are never reported in the newspaper because there are so many of them. A friend of mine had been shopping and was just about to get into her car, when a man who had been hiding under her car grabbed her ankles. Another man, working in cahoots with the man under the car, was hiding behind another car nearby, and he jumped out and grabbed my friend's purse, and the two of them got away and were never caught. The security guards never seem to be around when you need them. Please warn people, Abby. — Afraid Dear Afraid: Since the crime rate at the mall appears to be more than their security can handle, it might be better to consider shopping someplace that is better policed. If that's not possible, do not go to the mall unless you are accompanied by at least one friend. And do not enter the parking structure unless it is daylight, or well-lighted, or you are carrying a flashlight powerful enough to illuminate the underside and the interior of your car from a distance (and large enough to be used as a weapon should you have to). Your letter is thought-provoking. Readers, before getting into your cars, look under them, around and behind you!

 Often an explanation will be offered for why the police or mall security agents aren't doing more to round up the bad guys, or why these attacks aren't being reported in mainstream news outlets. In the letter to Dear Abby, the lack of reporting is ascribed to there being too many of these incidents for them to be newsworthy, and Brunvand quotes one of the legend's recounters as saying, \"Plenty of things like that never get into the papers.\" (Police and newspapers are said to be keeping the attacks under wraps to protect business at the mall.) It's not enough we have to worry about ankle-slashing bad guys lurking under our cars; according to lore, we face this danger on our own because the police and the press are in cahoots with Big Business and thus turn a blind eye when some of the citizens of our fair town end up victimized in this fashion! What appears to have begun as a cautionary tale about women being targeted for robbery or rape has, in the last few years, grown more and more into another tale about ruthless gang initiations. As inner city gang activity plays a greater part of the nightly news broadcast, our lore changes to reflect this emerging focus of our fears. In earlier versions, what the woman could be compelled to part with (her valuables or her virtue) was key to her attacker's motivation; in its newer form, it's almost violence for violence's sake. [Collected on the Internet, 1999] I am passing this along because I know of a incident similar to this. My girlfriend was getting some gas and when she attempted to return to her car the gas station attendant starting yelling at her and telling her she did not pay yet. When she went back in to argue about having already paid the attendant told her he just wanted to get her back in because he saw someone crawl in the backseat of her car, and that he had already called the police. So it's worth taking to heart. This is a true story. it has been \"ritual\" of gang members to take one body part from women as an initiation into gangs. the rule is that is has to be in a well lit area and at a gas station, so be careful. they tend to lay under the car, and slash females' ankles when she goes to get in her car, causing her to fall and then they cut off a body part and roll and run. they are known to hide behind the gas pumps too, so be careful. It might sound bizarre and gross, but the bigger the body part the higher the initiation they receive. This was commmunicated by a person who works in law enforcement in the south. She has investigated and been called to a number of these scenes. She has also confirmed the following statement below as true and not an internet \"hoax.\" Please pass these on to as many people you know... mothers, sisters, grandparents, daughters, nieces and friends. It seems the world has become a crazy place to live in, but let's be careful out there and make stuff like this known so we are better protected.

 (Another gang initiation legend can be found on our Lights Out! page.) One could consider this legend to be about our sense of vulnerability to attack, heightened by having to frequent exposed, impersonal places. As much as we think of shopping malls as well-lit, warm, welcoming, busy, safe places to be, the pendulum swings the other way when it comes to their parking lots — having to leave the security of the mall to venture alone into the darkness would stir up a feeling of anxiety even if there were no crime in the world! On a more basic level, this legend awakens half-forgotten memories of childhood fears; namely, the bogeyman under the bed. Who didn't anticipate having his ankles grabbed by that monster? Barbara \"fear not the tendoncies of those who lurk\" Mikkelson Sightings: The 1983 Stephen King novel Pet Semetary features an ankle-slashing culprit hiding under a bed. It also shows up in gruesome fashion in the 1998 slasher classic Urban Legend. Last updated: 29 March 2011

"Barbara Mikkelson" 1999-10-17 "A woman becomes suspicious of the contents of a letter a blind man asks her to deliver when she sees him scurry away without the aid of his cane." "Claim: A woman becomes suspicious of the contents of a letter a blind man asks her to deliver when she sees him scurry away without the aid of his cane. LEGEND Example: [Collected on the Internet, 1996]  She started out to deliver the message, when she turned around to see if there was anything else the blind man needed. But she spotted him hurrying through the crowd without his smoked glasses or white cane. She went to the police, who raided the address on the envelope, where they found heaps of human flesh for sale. And what was in the envelope? \"This is the last one I am sending you today.\"
 Origins: It's possible this chilling legend grew out of a particular branch of \"blood simple\" rumors rampant at the end of World War II. In the spring of 1946, occupation troops in Germany encountered the spurious tale about Polish Jews slaughtering 17-year-old German girls and selling their flesh on the black market. The age-old slander about Jews killing Christian youngsters to obtain flesh or blood for use in rituals (blood libel rumors) had been twisted by the reality of the times into Jews murdering for profit in a war-torn shortage-ridden land. Whatever the hardships endured in post-war Berlin, there's no record of fresh-slaughtered fraulein being marketed nor of girls being rounded up by organized gangs of butchers. The themes of this tale run through other murdering madmen legends. Like the almost victims in the Hairy-Armed Hitchhiker (woman who stops to pick up an \"old lady\" stranded on a dark country road or who is asked by one in a mall parking lot for a ride barely escapes the clutches of a murderer) and the Mall Grab warning (woman is lured into a van by way of a ruse involving a sick baby), the heroine in this story is almost undone by her desire to help someone she perceives as both harmless and in need of assistance. Such legends impart a caution about never relaxing one's guard around even the innocuous-appearing. Stay alert and stay alive, say these legends. In common with the horror classic Aren't You Glad You Didn't Turn On The Light? (coed awakens to discover both a murdered roommate and a blood-curdling message scrawled on the wall), the focus of this tale remains on the one that got away, not on the one(s) murdered. Her close call becomes our close call, further underscoring the lesson of fear legends such as these are used to instill. Barbara \"fear of frying\" Mikkelson Last updated: 22 January 2011

"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/mummy-titantic/" "false" "The ancient artifact that inspired this ghost story can still be seen at the British Museum." "Barbara Mikkelson" 1999-10-09 "The Titanic went to a watery grave carrying a cursed mummy in its hold." "The following tale sends chills down your spine, doesn't it? Of all tales of the supernatural, this one is perhaps the best documented, the most disturbing and the most difficult to explain ...  The Princess of Amen-Ra lived some 1,500 years before Christ. When she died, she was laid in an ornate wooden coffin and buried deep in a vault at Luxor, on the banks of the Nile. In the late 1890s, 4 rich young Englishmen visiting the excavations at Luxor were invited to buy an exquisitely fashioned mummy case containing the remains of Princess of Amen-Ra. They drew lots. The man who won paid several thousand pounds and had the coffin taken to his hotel. A few hours later, he was seen walking out towards the desert. He never returned. The next day, one of the remaining 3 men was shot by an Egyptian servant accidentally. His arm was so severely wounded it had to be amputated. The third man in the foursome found on his return home that the bank holding his entire savings had failed. The fourth guy suffered a severe illness, lost his job and was reduced to selling matches in the street. Nevertheless, the coffin reached England (causing other misfortunes along the way), where it was bought by a London businessman. After 3 of his family members had been injured in a road accident and his house damaged by fire, the businessman donated it to the British Museum. As the coffin was being unloaded from a truck in the museum courtyard, the truck suddenly went into reverse and trapped a passerby. Then as the casket was being lifted up the stairs by 2 workmen, 1 fell and broke his leg. The other, apparently in perfect health, died unaccountably two days later. Once the Princess was installed in the Egyptian Room, trouble really started. The Museum's night watchmen frequently heard frantic hammering and sobbing from the coffin. Other exhibits in the room were also often hurled about at night. One watchman died on duty; making the other watchmen wanting to quit. Cleaners refused to go near the Princess too. When a visitor derisively flicked a dustcloth at the face painted on the coffin, his child died of measles soon afterwards. Finally, the authorities had the mummy carried down to the basement figuring it could not do any harm down there. Within a wk, one of the helpers was seriously ill, and the supervisor of the move was found dead on his desk. By now, the papers had heard of it. A journalist photographer took a picture of the mummy case and when he developed it, the painting on the coffin was of a horrifying, human face. The photographer was said to have gone home then, locked his bedroom door and shot himself. Soon afterwards, the museum sold the mummy to a private collector. After continual misfortune (and deaths), the owner banished it to the attic. A well known authority on the occult, Madame Helena Blavatsky, visited the premises. Upon entry, she was sized with a shivering fit and searched the house for the source of an evil influence of incredible intensity; She finally came to the attic and found the mummy case. Can you exorcise this evil spirit? Asked the owner. There is no such thing as exorcism. Evil remains evil forever. Nothing can be done about it. I implore you to get rid of this evil as soon as possible. But no British museum would take the mummy; the fact that almost 20 people had met with misfortune, disaster or death from handling the casket, in barely 10 years, was now well known. Eventually, a hardheaded American archaeologist (who dismissed the happenings as quirks of circumstance), paid a handsome price for the mummy and arranged for its removal to New York. In Apr 1912, the new owner escorted its treasure aboard a sparkling, new White Star liner about to make its maiden voyage to New York. On the night of April 14, amid scenes of unprecedented horror, the Princess of Amen-Ra accompanied 1,500 passengers to their deaths at the bottom of the Atlantic. The name of the ship was of course, the H.M.S. TITANIC [sic]. Ah, but it's only a ghost story: no mummy (cursed or otherwise) was carried as cargo by the ill-fated RMS Titanic on its one and only voyage. First of all, the tale is logically inconsistent. One of the few names quoted in the piece is that of Helena Blavatsky, a well-known occultist of the period. And we're told the dreaded Princess of Amen-Ra was purchased in Luxor, Egypt, by four foolish young Englishmen \"in the late 1890s,\" while later in the same piece we're informed of Helena Blavatsky's dire pronouncements to the private collector who supposedly had possession of the mummy right before it was shipped on the Titanic. These claims cannot both be true, because Helena Blavatsky died of influenza in 1891, but the Titanic's first and only voyage didn't take place until 1912. As for the facts of the matter, in 1985, Charles Haas, president of the national Titanic Historical Society, gained access to the ship's cargo manifest and cargo diagrams. Though the cargo included raw feathers, linen, straw, hatter's fur, tissue, auto parts, leather, rabbit hair, elastics, hair nets and refrigerating apparatus, not so much as one mummy was listed. Speaking to the legend that a cursed mummy was on board, Haas said, \"The cargo manifest throws those myths right out the window.\" Other experts have come to the same conclusion: no mummy — least of all one \"of the vengeful Princess of Amen-Ra\" — was shipped aboard the Titanic. (Of course, the fact that the ship's manifest listed no gold and no insurance claims were filed for valuable gems hasn't stopped people from believing that those objects went down with the Titanic as well.) Note that \"Amen-Ra\" isn't the name of a place; it's the name of an Egyptian god, one whose name means \"the hidden one\". He was seen as the creator of all things and, with his consort Mut and their son the moon-god Khonshu, was worshipped in the great temples of Luxor and Karnak. In fact, the mummy to which this story refers (which was actually just the coffin lid, not the mummy, of the Priestess of Amun) never left the British Museum, and it is still there to this day. So how did this fanciful tale begin? This ghost story was concocted around the turn of the century by two Englishmen named William Stead and Douglas Murray. Stead was a well-known journalist and editor who crusaded on behalf of liberal causes and created a national scandal when he published an article entitled \"The Maiden Tribute of Modern Babylon,\" describing how he was able to purchase the services of a thirteen-year-old prostitute for £5. Stead was also a believer in mysticism and spiritualism who consulted mediums, investigated psychic phenomena, and published a related periodical. We don't know much about Murray — he's been described as an \"Egyptologist\" and as the man who shipped the mummy in question to London in the first place, although he was probably neither. Stead and Murray crafted an elaborate horror story about a mummy that was brought to England and set up in the drawing room of an acquaintance of theirs. The morning after the mummy arrived, they claimed, everything breakable in the room was destroyed. The mummy was moved from room to room within the house, but each move resulted in the same destruction of all the breakable objects at hand. Wherever the mummy went, it brought sickness, death and destruction to its owner. Sometime after Stead and Murray invented their mummy tale, they were visiting the First Egyptian Room of the British Museum and noticed the coffin lid of the Priestess of Amun. They concocted yet another story that the look of terror and anguish in the face depicted on the coffin lid indicated that the coffin's original occupant was a tormented soul, and her evil spirit was now loose in the world. Stead and Murray told their fanciful tale to eager newspaper reporters who — then as now — weren't about to let the truth get in the way of a sensationally good story. The two stories were conflated into one and spread widely, and the Priestess of Amun came to be identified as the mummy whose mortal remains wreaked havoc wherever they were stored. This ghost story made the leap from London to the Titanic after William Stead went down with the ill-fated ship on 15 April 1912. Stead was traveling to America at President Taft's request to address a peace conference, and he took delight in relating his \"cursed mummy\" tale to Titanic passengers. He reportedly defied superstition by starting his narrative at a dinner party on Friday, the 12th of April, and drew it out so that he concluded the tale just after midnight on the 13th. A few days after the Titanic's sinking, one of the survivors recounted Stead's \"cursed mummy\" tale in an interview with the New York World, and eventually the ghost story Stead and Murray invented, Stead's presence aboard the Titanic, and reports of Stead's having related the mummy tale to Titanic passengers became jumbled together, producing a new legend about an actual mummy aboard the Titanic. The modified legend told of a cursed mummy the British Museum was so anxious to be rid of that they sold it to an American, who naturally sought to ship it back home via the Titanic. The presence of the cursed mummy (which had escalated the expressions of its wrath from breaking cups and saucers and making people ill to sinking passenger liners) in the Titanic's hold came to be whispered as the cause of the most famous maritime disaster in history. In an even more elaborate version of the legend, the mummy's American owner paid a bribe to have the mummy placed in one of the Titanic's lifeboats; it was then smuggled aboard the Carpathia when that ship picked up the Titanic's survivors and secretly landed in New York. When the mummy continued to wreak havoc at its new home, its new owner had it taken to Canada in preparation for shipping it back to England. The mummy was placed aboard the liner Empress of Ireland, which, while on its way from Quebec City to Liverpool on 29 May 1914, was struck by a Norwegian coal ship. The Empress of Ireland sank so quickly that only 7 of her 40 lifeboats could be launched, and 840 passengers went down with her. As to how widespread this \"curse of the mummy\" stuff is, some of the crew members on a failed 1980 expedition to locate the sunken Titanic spoke darkly of the famous mummy that was allegedly on board her, saying it transferred the curse of all who disturbed its grave to the vessel's maiden voyage and all subsequent search efforts. (Yeah. Like it couldn't have been plain bad luck. And what was the mummy doing back on the Titanic after having sailed on the Empress of Ireland?) In looking to blame their bad luck on an outside force they couldn't possibly have hoped to defeat, those crew members weren't all that unusual. They merely brought into play a standard avoidance technique employed to keep us from having to confront what a scary, random world this place can be. In the wake of any disaster, there's a strong urge to explain away the tragedy by ascribing it to some dark power beyond our control. As inconceivable as this might seem at first blush, it's easier for many people to accept that a cursed mummy was the cause of great loss of life than it is to co-exist with the knowledge that sometimes even unthinkable accidents will happen. Being at the mercy of the God of Random Chance is far more frightening a reality to face than any vengeful mummy will ever be. Ghost stories like this one reaffirm our faith in the world being a predictable (and therefore safe) place. If a great tragedy such as the sinking of the Titanic can be explained away as the direct result of the evil forces of the supernatural's being stirred up, we can again feel safe about placing our faith in the inherent safety of great ships, airplanes or even automobiles. Beyond the reassurance factor, such tales also make darned good storytelling. That too lies at the heart of their appeal. In case you're curious (and have some vacation time to spare), the coffin lid of the Priestess of Amun is still on display at the British Museum, just as it was when Stead and Murray created their infamous \"cursed mummy\" tale a century ago. Look for exhibit BM No. 22542, in the Second Egyptian Room." 1999 "Oct" 10 1890

"Snopes Staff" 1999-10-01 "Bodies of workmen are entombed in Hoover Dam." "Although a startling number of workmen were killed in the construction of Hoover Dam (1931-36), none are entombed in the structure. The myth of the concrete pour too important to halt to fish out a mere body is just that, a myth. (Agreement on the exact body count is hard to come by. The most common figure given is an official count of 96 and an unofficial one of 112.) At first blush it might appear reasonable that a dead man would have been left where he fell on a project this big, but structural integrity of the dam had to be maintained at all costs if it was to withstand pressure later. Engineers would not have permitted even a 4-inch block of wood to be left in a pour, much less anything as large as a workman, because of the danger of creating a weak spot in the structure. The dam contains 4,400,000 cubic yards of concrete. It was poured in sections of roughly a thousand cubic yards at a time, each of these slabs being allowed to set before the next was added. The 'cold joints' created by this sectioning were very deliberately factored into the engineering plans of the structure. Each segment took hours to pour, with the wet concrete arriving in buckets containing roughly eight yards of concrete each. Had someone lost his footing and fallen into the pour, he'd have easily righted himself or, if injured, been easily pulled from the wet mass by others. Another famous engineering marvel of a bygone time is often rumored to have workmen buried in it. 27 men died during the construction of the Brooklyn Bridge (1870-1883), but none ended up becoming part of the structure. Possibly rumors about bodies left in Hoover Dam originated with memories of a Montana dam construction tragedy being attributed to the larger, more famous structure in Nevada. Rumors do tend to migrate towards the most recognizable entry in any field, so it can be postulated that gruesome facts about the fatal slide at the Fort Peck Dam were later recalled as having to do with the Hoover Dam. Both dams are, after all, in the same part of the country and were built around the same time. The Fort Peck Dam was erected in Montana between 1934 and 1940, and was at the time of its construction the largest earth-filled dam in the world. On 22 September 1938, a section of the dam broke loose and slid into the lake below. Eight workers were buried in the debris, and only two of the bodies were recovered, leaving six forever entombed within the mass of the structure." 1999 "Oct" 10 1870

"Barbara Mikkelson" 1999-09-19 "A menacing dream prevents a woman from being killed in an accident." "The \"coachman's warning\" legend has been kicking around since 1906 when it was told in Pall Mall Magazine as the E.F. Benson short story The Bus-Conductor. In that long-ago version, a man has the presaging encounter that saves his life through a disturbing late-night exchange with the driver of a hearse that pulls up to the home where he is staying as a houseguest. The hearse driver (who is puzzlingly dressed as a bus conductor) locks eyes with the man, gestures at his empty conveyance, and announces, \"Just room for one inside, sir.\" A month later, that same unsettling man attempts to gesture the former houseguest into a bus he'd been planning to take, once again with \"Just room for one inside, sir.\" The terrified man backs away then runs off. Moments later, the bus is struck from the side by a car traveling too fast, the automobile \"burrowing into it as a gimlet burrows into a board, making matchwood and — other things of it.\" A well-known version of the yarn surfaces in Bennett Cerf's 1944 Famous Ghost Stories. More modern tellings present the narrowly-avoided fatal accident as the falling of an elevator car and the person so warned (and thus saved) as a woman. A young woman on her way to town broke her journey by staying with friends at an old manor house. Her bedroom looked out to the carriage sweep at the front door. It was a moonlit night, and she found it difficult to sleep. As the clock outside her bedroom door struck 12, she heard the noise of horses' hooves on the gravel outside, and the sound of wheels. She got up and went over to the window to see who could be arriving at that time of night. The moonlight was very bright, and she saw a hearse drive up to the door. It hadn't a coffin in it; instead it was crowded with people. The coachman sat high up on the box: as he came opposite the window he drew up and turned his head. His face terrified her, and he said in a distinct voice, \"There's room for one more.\" She drew the curtain, ran back to bed, and covered her head with the bedclothes. In the morning she was not quite sure whether it had been a dream, or whether she had really got out of bed and seen the hearse, but she was glad to go up to town and leave the old house behind her. She was shopping in a big store which had an elevator in it — an up-to-date thing at that time. She was on the top floor, and went to the elevator to go down. It was rather crowded, but as she came up to it, the elevator operator turned his head and said, \"There's room for one more.\" It was the face of the coachman of the hearse. \"No, thank you,\" said the girl. \"I'll walk down.\" She turned away, the elevator doors clanged, there was a terrible rush and screaming and shouting, and then a great clatter and thud. The elevator had fallen and every soul in it was killed. No matter the mode whereby others perish or the sex of the person spared, the eerie coachman remains a constant element of the tale. Sometimes the forewarned recognizes the vehicle the midnight coachman shows up in as a hearse, but sometimes sees only an unremarkable coach and is left puzzled by why the driver's appearance and invitation are so unsettling. Sightings: The plot of the 1945 film Dead of Night was based on this legend, as was an episode of the television anthology series The Twilight Zone (\"Twenty-Two,\" original air date 10 February 1961)." 1999 "Sep" 9 1900

"Barbara Mikkelson" 1999-09-17 "A man turns to bid his unusual hitchhiker goodbye and discovers that she has disappeared from the car. He later learns that his mysterious passenger had died several years earlier." "Vanishing hitchhiker stories as we now tell them date to the turn of the century, but their predecessors go back centuries before that. As time rolled on, the wagons and horses of older times transformed into the cars of today. According to folklorist Jan Brunvand, the legend of the vanishing hitchhiker evolved from earlier European stories, usually about travelers on horseback. In Hawaii, the hitchhiker became associated with the ancient volcano goddess Pele. A prototype of the story shows up in the New Testament (Acts 8:26-39), in which an Ethiopian driving a chariot picks up the Apostle Philip, who baptizes him and then disappears. The most common version of the legend involves a driver who stops for a strange girl on a highway, then during the course of the ride realizes his hitchhiker has disappeared. Upon arriving at the address the girl had mentioned, the driver learns from her relatives that she has been dead for years: A dozen miles outside of Baltimore, the main road from New York (Route Number One) is crossed by another important highway. It is a dangerous intersection, and there is talk of building and underpass for the east-west road. To date, however, the plans exist only on paper. Dr. Eckersall was driving home from a country-club dance late one Saturday night. He slowed up for the intersection, and was surprised to see a lovely young girl, dressed in the sheerest of evening gowns, beckoning him for a lift. He jammed on his brakes, and motioned her to climb into the back seat of his roadster. \"All cluttered up with golf clubs and bags up here in front,\" he explained. \"But what on earth is a youngster like you doing out here all alone at this time of night?\" \"It's too long a story to tell you now,\" said the girl. Her voice was sweet and somewhat shrill — like the tinkling of sleigh bells. \"Please, please take me home. I'll explain everything there. The address is ___ North Charles Street. I do hope it's not too far out of your way.\" The doctor grunted, and set the car in motion. He drove rapidly to the address she had given him, and as he pulled up before the shuttered house, he said, \"Here we are.\" Then he turned around. The back seat was empty! \"What the devil?\" the doctor muttered to himself. The girl couldn't possibly have fallen from the car. Nor could she simply have vanished. He rang insistently on the house bell, confused as he had never been in his life before. At long last the door opened. A gray-haired, very tired-looking man peered out at him. \"I can't tell you what an amazing thing has happened,\" began the doctor. \"A young girl gave me this address a while back. I drove her here and . . .\" \"Yes, yes, I know,\" said the man wearily. \"This has happened several other Saturday evenings in the past month. That young girl, sir, was my daughter. She was killed in an automobile accident at that intersection where you saw her almost two years ago . . . .\" Another popular version stars a hitchhiker who makes a prophesy before vanishing in front of the driver's eyes. Good crops, the end of a war, a natural catastrophe about to strike, or the imminent coming of Jesus have been predicted by these vanishing prophets. At the completion of some of these tales, the driver seeks out the police to report the incident and is told he's the fourth person this has happened to this week. Vanishing prophets who predict catastrophes are often said to look like Jesus. This form of the legend often surfaces in the wake of a natural disaster, with the encounter said to have happened maybe all of a week before things went to hell in a handbasket. The vanishing prophet set of stories contains a smaller subset in which the prediction of one future event is bolstered by the prediction of a second, equally unbelievable, event which subsequently comes true. The hitchhiker sometimes vanishes after making the predictions: In the wake of the anxiety rumors that swept the nation immediately after Pearl Harbor came a pipe-dream rumor which was undoubtedly the most popular of all: the weird tale of the man who picked up a strange woman in his car. Arriving at her destination, his passenger allegedly offered to pay the man for the gas he had used. But the man refused to accept the money, so the woman offered to tell his fortune. And, as the rumor went, mysteriously she told him, \"There will be a dead body in your car before you get home, and Hitler will be dead in six months.\" Supposedly, then, on the way home the man had seen a serious automobile wreck and had taken one of the victims into his car to rush him to the hospital. But the injured person died en route, which left the hopeful implication that Hitler would therefore be dead within the following six months. Although this pipe dream sounds foolish, it nevertheless spread throughout the country rapidly. It appeared in widely circulated gossip columns, and a lot of Americans took it seriously. Yet this same rumor, in the setting of the period, to be sure, had appeared in every military conflict since the Napoleonic Wars. And it has been said that the rumor probably goes back into the Middle Ages. The appeal of vanishing hitchhiker stories lies in the nature of the encounter — an interaction with a ghost occurs not because the main character went looking for the supernatural, but because it came to him. Such tales underscore the belief that representatives from the spirit world can be encountered at any time and by anyone. Adding to the horror factor is the specter's passing for a living person. That the driver does not recognize it as a ghost during their time together makes it all that more easy to believe we won't recognize a ghost when we meet one, either. Variations: Vanishing hitchhikers appear in numerous songs and in the 1951 Orson Welles' short film Return to Glennascaul, the 1985 movie Mr. Wrong, and the 1824 Washington Irving novel The Lady With The Velvet Collar. In 1998 K-Mart ran a vanishing hitchhiker commercial to advertise its Route 66 jeans. Also told in: Healey, Phil and Rick Glanvill. Now! That's What I Call Urban Myths.

"Barbara Mikkelson" 1999-09-13 "A motorcyclist's coat worn backwards leads to his demise." "Claim: A motorcyclist's coat worn backwards leads to his demise.  Examples:  It seems a motorcyclist was riding and wearing his jacket as he always did, backwards; this unorthodox method made the jacket more airtight and was more comfortable while riding. Of course someone had to always zip and unzip him. One day the cyclist had a minor accident and fell off his bike. A \"Good Samaritan\" saw this from his car, got out, saw the cyclist and determined his accident caused his head to be turned completely around. He felt action was necessary so he tried to twist the cyclist's head back to its proper position. This of course broke the motorcyclist's neck.
 
 [Cerf, 1948] Peggy Wood, the operetta star, watched the rain pouring down one night from the haven of a warm, friendly drawing room, and remembered this story she had heard years before in England. A country doctor, cursing the luck that called him out on the worst night of the year, was splashing his way homeward on his motorcycle, on an old road full of bumps and holes. Suddenly he heard a cry for help. A luckless motorist had skidded off the road, and his car was up to the hubs in mud in a ditch. \"Obviously I cannot pull you out with this motorcycle,\" said the doctor, \"but if you'll hitch on behind me, I'll ride you into town. It's only three or four miles, and we'll find someone there to drive you back and get your car on the road again.\" Before the grateful motorist climbed aboard the cycle, he was advised by the doctor to reverse his rain-coat, back to front, to protect him a little better from the driving rain. Then they set out on the rocky road to town. The doctor said nothing until he saw the first lights of the main street flickering through the storm. \"Here we are,\" he pointed out then. \"We'll soon have help for you.\" When there was no reply, the doctor looked behind him. He was alone on the motorcycle. \"Good heavens,\" he thought, \"the poor fellow must have fallen off!\" He turned the cycle about and began retracing the ground. A mile back he came upon his erstwhile passenger, lying motionless on the road, surrounded by a small group of wet and bedraggled cottagers. \"Is he badly hurt?\" cried the doctor. \"I'm afraid so,\" answered one of the cottagers. \"We were in our house yonder when we heard his moans above the wind and the storm. When we found him he was in terrible shape, sir. His head had been twisted clear around! My son and I twisted it back just as fast as we could, but ever since, he hasn't moved or made a single sound!\"
 Origins: As the second example indicates, this tale was circulating in England \"years before\" 1948, but the fear it expresses is still very much a contemporary one: What if you were grievously injured in an accident and were unable to communicate a vital piece of information to your rescuers? In this case that anxiety is expressed through a bit of macabre humor — the injured motorcyclist cannot inform the good samaritans who come to his aid that it's his jacket, not his head, that's turned around backwards — but the proliferation of bracelets bearing important medical information about the wearer (such as allergies to certain types of drugs) indicates that this fear is very much grounded in reality. In \"single rider\" versions of the tale, it's silly to believe our hero would choose to be helped in and out of his jacket every time he wanted to take his bike for a run. For that to be true, the rider would have to rely on someone always being around to see him off and on someone predisposed to help him always being wherever he's going. This is a far cry from the Easy Rider lifestyle of the open road and having the freedom to do what you want when you want. There's no reason for the coat-reverse, either. Motorcycle jackets are constructed to be windproof, with additional leather flanging built in underneath the zipper's track. Wearing one backwards isn't going to protect the rider any better than wearing it with the zipper facing forward. In \"injured passenger\" forms of the story, the coat being worn backwards again doesn't make sense, but this time not because of the garment's construction. No, it's the position of the passenger which gives lie to the tale. Many bike passengers ride with their fronts pressed up against the one doing the driving. Even those who choose to sit back on the bike with their hands hooked under the seat or to a bar behind them still benefit from the windshielding effect of the driver's back. Neither type of passenger — the hugger or the stand-offish — is going to be much affected by rain or wind, at least in the chest area. (Backs, arms, legs, and heads will get rained on and chilled mightily, though.) The only way this legend has a chance of coming true would be in a single rider version wherein the rider was content to rely on others to bundle him into and extract him from a non-motorcycle jacket. This apocryphal lad would still have to have the accident which renders him unconscious, and would still have to be happened upon by someone who would take it upon himself to twist the head back around the right way instead of hieing off to notify the police and summon competent medical help. Oh yes; and the samaritan would also have to fail to notice the victim's head and knees face the same direction, or would have to write off such an observation to a rare double-twisted injury in which the torso is rotated 180 degrees from the legs as well as 180 degrees from the head, meaning the whole thing had been cranked 360 degrees.

 Origins: Just when you thought danger couldn't possibly be lurking  anywhere else, up pops a warning about poison-saturated deposit envelopes. The above warning began circulating on the Internet in June 1999. It's just as false as the strychnine on payphones scare, another 1999 hoax about dangerous substances deliberately left on public machines. There are no such envelopes, and there hasn't been any such death. When asked about the e-mailed warning, Sunnybrook and Women's College Health and Sciences Centre said it is not connected with the note and has no Dr. Elliot on staff. \"It's a hoax,\" said Kathleen Harte, manager of communications for Toronto Public Health. \"We have no such person on staff. The public health department doesn't have a crime unit. There is no death to our knowledge that occurred. If somebody had died of cyanide poisoning we would have heard about this.\" The Canadian Bankers Association said it doubts anyone took the e-mailed warning seriously. \"I think people are smarter than that,\" said CBA spokesman Bliss Baker. I think the CBA is charming in its naivete. In July 1999, the original text of this bit of scarelore was altered to indicate the poisoning had taken place at a Bank of America ATM and that the letter writer had just heard about this \"at 3:45 p.m. on KDIA radio station.\" This version is every bit as false as the previous one.

"David Mikkelson" 1999-07-31 "The movie The Blair Witch Project is based on footage shot by three student filmmakers who mysteriously disappeared while making a documentary about the legend of the Blair Witch." "It sounds like one of the spookiest movies ever. As the ads for the film The Blair Witch Project state: In October of 1994, three student filmmakers disappeared in the woods near Burkittsville, Maryland while shooting a documentary. A year later their footage was found The official web site for The Blair Witch Project explains the mythology behind the Blair Witch legend that these students were supposedly investigating: In 1785, a woman accused of witchcraft is banished from the village of Blair, Maryland, and a year later, her accusers and half of Blair's children vanish. The town of Burkittsville is established at the site of the abandoned village about forty years later, and over the next 150 years a series of child murders and mutilations takes place. In 1994, three students decide to travel to Burkittsville to film interviews with locals about the Blair Witch legend as a class project, and a couple of days later they disappear in nearby woods. No trace of them is found until the footage they shot is discovered under an old cabin a year later. Scary, isn't it? And early reports of the film indicate that it lives up to its chilling reputation. We hate to spoil something so deliciously horrific, but the truth is that the film isn't really what it's described to be. First of all, the \"facts\" behind the Blair Witch legend are apocryphal. The rare 1809 book The Blair Witch Cult, which is \"commonly considered fiction\" and \"tells of an entire town cursed by an outcast witch,\" isn't real. (As the web site informs us, only one copy of the book exists, conveniently in the hands of an unnamed private collector.) A hermit who allegedly \"ritualistically murdered and disemboweled\" seven children in 1940-41 at the behest of \"an old woman ghost who occupied the woods near his house\" was \"quickly convicted and hanged,\" yet none of the area newspapers apparently saw fit to cover this sensational story. When the three student filmmakers allegedly disappeared in 1994, the Maryland State Police reportedly spent ten days and \"33,000 man hours\" employing dogs, helicopters, a hundred men, and even a \"fly over by a Department of Defense Satellite\" to locate them, but once again media coverage of this sensational, newsworthyevent was completely non-existent. (The citizens of Burkittsville and the Frederick County Sheriff's Department are happy to confirm the fictionality of these events.) So what's the film all about? The legend of the Blair Witch was invented by the film's writer/directors, Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sánchez. Myrick and Sánchez hired three young actors (Heather Donahue, Michael Williams, and Joshua Leonard), explained the outline of the film's story to them, gave them advice about the characters they were to play, then turned them loose in the woods with film equipment to shoot movie footage. The actors received notes and supplies left for them and carried a Global Positioning System (GPS) device with them for tracking purposes, but they didn't know exactly what was going to happen once they embarked on their movie-making venture — thus the film has the feel of a documentary that captures events genuinely surprising to the filmmakers. (If you're still convinced the movie's premise is real, perhaps the fact that the \"dead\" film students are giving interviews — such as the one in Salon — will dissuade you.) Adding to the movie's pre-release build-up was the airing on the Sci-Fi Channel of a fictional documentary, The Curse of the Blair Witch, about the putative Blair Witch legend and the making of the related film. (Remember, the \"Fi\" in \"Sci-Fi\" stands for fiction.) It sounds like a spine-tingling premise for a horror film, and it has reportedly made for a terrific movie. But it's just a film, not a true story. Additional information:" 1999 "Jul" 7 1780

"Barbara Mikkelson" 1999-07-28 "A cuckolded husband presented his wife with the head of her lover." "Our grisly tale begins with this newspaper clipping from December 1993: FULDA, Germany, Dec 8 (AFP) - An American soldier cut off the head of his pregnant wife's lover and put it on her bedside table in the hospital here where she was about to give birth, a spokesman at the German public prosecutor's office said on Wednesday. The angry husband struck on Tuesday when his rival, a fellow GI in the American 11th cavalry regiment, was phoning the woman from nearby Sickels military airfield. The first soldier cut off the second one's head with a knife, then drove to the hospital and showed it to his wife and left it there. The victim just had time to call down the telephone, \"Your husband is coming,\" the German sources said. An American army spokesman confirmed a decapitated body had been found in a telephone box at the military airfield. U.S. military police held the first man for questioning. He was not immediately named. You might think that so gruesome a tale couldn't get worse, but you'd be wrong. In December of 1993, Gregory Glover paid the ultimate penalty for messing with another fellow's wife. His friend, Stephen Schap, didn't take the news of Glover's wrongdoings all that gracefully, coming as it was from his pregnant wife's lips with her about to give birth to this other man's child. Leading up to this gruesome event was the breakdown of the Schaps' marriage. Posted to a U.S. Army airfield in Germany, Sgt. Schap and his wife grew apart over time, a condition Schap was seemingly unaware of, but one with which his wife was all too painfully in touch. Communication broke down, loneliness set in, and a friendship with one of her husband's army buddies progressed from the platonic to the physical. Diane Schap asked for a divorce at various times, citing marital breakdown as her reason, but her husband always managed to talk her into trying again. He was unaware (or perhaps uncaring) of the depth of her dissatisfaction and completely in the dark about her involvement with another man. As well, there was the coming child to consider, a child Schap did not know was not his. And so the stage was set in early December of 1993. Schap discovered indications of his wife's infidelity from reading her diary while she was away for a weekend visiting a girlfriend. Though she'd previously asked for a divorce, she'd never mentioned her relationship with Glover. The news in her diary came as a shock to Schap; upon her return he asked her pointblank if she'd been sleeping with his friend. She assured him she had not been, and this assurance appeared to satisfy her husband. He contacted the base chaplain the next day to make arrangements for Diane to return to the States; the two of them had finally reached agreement on a divorce. Diane was hospitalized on December 7 for complications relating to her pregnancy. It was then that she decided that her husband must be told about the parentage of the child she was carrying. She shared her news with him from her hospital bed, and he initially appeared to take it well. (Since Schap had already resigned himself to the marriage's being over, perhaps this wasn't all that unexpected a response.) Within the hour he returned in an agitated state, demanding to know details of who her lover was and where they'd made love. After this confrontation, Schap left \"to pack his things.\" In reality he went to seek out Glover. Schap found him in a phone booth on the base, in the process of conversing with Diane. The lovers had been speaking for 5 or 10 minutes, Diane testified, when Glover suddenly swore twice. The second expletive was \"cut off mid-breath,\" she said. \"Then all I heard was the dial tone.\" Glover suffered slight knife wounds in the telephone booth, then tried to escape on foot. He ran a short distance but slipped and fell, and Schap was quickly on top of him, according to witnesses. Schap stabbed his victim 10 to 15 times before beheading him. We quote Diane Schap's recollection of the events from her description of them at Schap's trial: After checking into a German hospital in Fulda that day, she had been obliged to confess to her husband that she was pregnant by another man. A few hours later she was speaking by phone with that other man, Glover, a personable 21-year-old soldier who was a friend to both the Schaps. The line suddenly went dead. Now, around a half-hour later, she heard footsteps coming quickly down the hospital hallway. She recognized them as her husband's. The door burst open, and there stood Stephen Schap, according to her testimony, his chest heaving, clothes speckled with blood. He was carrying a Head gym bag. \"He had the sports bag over his shoulder, and it looked like it was full,\" she said. It was. Her husband reached into the bag, she said, and pulled out Glover's head. \"He grasped the head in both hands and he tried to push it in my face. I kept screaming and screaming,\" she said, sobbing as she testified. \"Look, Diane — Glover's here! He'll sleep with you every night now. Only you won't sleep — because all you'll see is this,\" Stephen Schap told her, according to her testimony. Doctors who had heard the terrified screams ran to the room. There they found Diane Schap, her face pale with shock, bedclothes spattered with blood. Stephen Schap sat at the foot of the bed, across his wife's legs. And on the night stand, facing Diane Schap, was Glover's head. Stephan Schap was courtmartialed for the murder of Gregory Glover in April 1994. He was found guilty and given a mandatory life sentence." 1999 "Jul" 7 1990

"Barbara Mikkelson" 1999-07-28 "A package containing a dead cat is stolen by a thief who thinks she's making off with something of value." "Claim: A package containing a dead cat is stolen by a thief who thinks she's making off with something of value. LEGEND Example: [Collected on the Internet, 1997]  Origins: Recent  versions of this story often place it at the West Edmonton Mall in Canada or the Mall of America in the United States. In those incarnations the action supposedly takes place in the parking lot, where a Good Samaritan places the deceased beastie in a shopping bag, then retreats to her own car to watch so she'll be on hand to give an explanation when the cat's owner returns. Another woman comes along, filches the bag, and gets it back to her own car, where she opens it and is seen fainting dead away once she catches sight of her ill-gotten gains. (In some tellings, an ambulance is called and the still-unconscious woman is placed on a stretcher with what the emergency workers believe to be the poor dear's bag thoughtfully placed on her chest.) Now I'm going to ruin your day by telling you it never happened. Not only that, dead-cats-in-package stories are as old as the hills (one even turned up in a 1904 New York Times article.) Another standard version has an old woman taking her dear, departed Fluffy across town on a bus so she can bury her in a lovely park. Either thieves brazenly steal her package or her parcel somehow gets innocently switched with someone else's, and she arrives at her destination not with Fluffy but instead with a nice ham all wrapped up. (It's told both ways.) In a closely-related version, the woman takes the subway with her soon-to-be-buried cat, but this time the beastie is in a suitcase. While the woman is struggling up the steep stairs, a nice young boy offers to carry the suitcase up for her. She gratefully hands over the bag, and he hares off with dead Fluffy. (In this version you're left to imagine the lad's reaction when he pries it open.) The following tale of one man's efforts to track down this story comes out of David Jacobson's 1948 book, The Affairs of Dame Rumor: Through the association of ideas, a given concept turns into a dramatic event, such as the perennial wonder of the Dead-Cat-Come-to-Justice. A New York City newspaperman once decided to track down this tale. He had first heard it from a friend. Claiming to believe the story himself, the friend told the newspaperman about a woman who had placed her pet cat in a veterinary hospital where it later died. As she wished to give the animal a decent burial, the woman called for her pet's remains; and neatly wrapped in a box she received the dead cat. Along the way home, the woman stopped to do some shopping at Stern's department store on 42nd Street. While selecting her purchases, the woman placed the box on a near-by counter. But suddenly she looked around for it, and the box was gone. Stern's detectives began searching the store for the packaged body of the cat. Within a short time they found it. The opened box, the deceased animal leering out of it, was on the floor of a telephone booth. Alongside there lay the body of a woman, immediately identified as a well-known shoplifter who had been under the scrutiny of this and other stores for several months. The shoplifter had apparently taken her loot to the telephone booth, opened it, caught a glimpse of the dead cat, and dropped to the floor dead of a heart attack resulting from fright. His friend, the newspaperman learned, got the rumor about this macabre justice from two actors who lived in the neighboring apartment. The two knew the full truth of the story, according to the friend. Yet, interviewing the actors, the journalist found they had received the tale from a Christian Science practitioner, a man whose word they did not doubt as he had told them the rumor as gospel. The Christian Science practitioner willingly repeated this gospel before the newspaperman, adding that he had heard it from a woman. She was the friend of the dead cat's owner. She would give him the names of all the people involved. And, to be sure, this woman was full of the dead-cat wonder, according to thejournalist . . . Not that she actually knew the name of the animal's owner. But she had heard the rumor from her son-in-law, who knew all about it. \"He turned out to know everything about it,\" the newspaperman reported. \"He had heard the story firsthand from a passenger on a commuters' train whose aunt knew the lady who owned the dead cat.\" Still curious about the rumor, the newspaperman went to Stern's department store. There a somewhat firm, if not angered, chief detective swiftly assured him that nothing of the sort had happened. Neither had the local police station any record of either a dead shoplifter or a dead cat having been reported. While the newspaperman was playing ring-around-a-rosy with the Dead-Cat-Come-to-Justice rumor, it was having a gay time of its own. It was flying from table to table, from office to office on its cross-country journey. Readjusted to fit the local situation in Chicago, the rumor was an eye-opener, months later, when it became current talk. In California, the following year, people gasped in amazement as they heard about the fate of the shoplifter in the local department store. And at least one national magazine published the rumor as one of its truth-is-stranger-than-fiction features for the edification of the wonder-lovers among its loyal subscribers.

"David Mikkelson" 1999-07-11 "Halloween hanging stunt goes wrong and hangs a man for real." "<CENTER><IMG SRC=\"https://www.snopes.com/uploads/images/horrors/graphics/noosehead.jpg\"></CENTER> Imitating a grisly death by hanging is an annual feature of many Halloween \"haunt\" shows and spooky decorative displays, usually implemented by securing the victim in a harness that supports his weight when he drops from the gallows so that the noose placed over his head doesn't actually snap his neck or constrict his windpipe and prevent him from breathing. Unfortunately, on more than one occasion such stunts have gone wrong and resulted in actual deaths. <IMG HSPACE=16 VSPACE=16 WIDTH=42 HEIGHT=193 ALT=\"Just hangin' around\" SRC=\"https://www.snopes.com/uploads/images/horrors/graphics/noose.gif\" ALIGN=RIGHT BORDER=0> One such fatality was reported by the Chicago Tribune in October 1990: A teenager who pretended to hang from a gallows as part of a pre-Halloween hayride died while performing the stunt. Police said that hayride customers found the body of Brian Jewell, 17, hanging from the gallows, his feet touching the ground. The stunt had worked on other nights and there was no indication of foul play, prosecutor James Holzapfel said. The gallows was being checked for flaws, and an autopsy was performed. \"He's supposed to have the noose around his neck, but it's not a noose that tightens,\" said Holzapfel. Jewell would step down about one foot to the ground, making it appear he had been hanged, Holzapfel said. During the ride, about 40 people are driven past several Halloween fright exhibits. The stunt went off without problems earlier [that day]. But the tractor driver became concerned later, when Jewell failed to give a speech he normally made as the wagon passed.
 A 15-year-old staging a gallows scene at a Halloween party accidentally hanged himself when the noose somehow tightened, authorities said today. William Anthony Odom of Charlotte, N.C., was pronounced dead Friday night amid fake spider webs and plastic bats decorating an aunt's home. Odom and several of his friends had staged a haunted house in the basement. Other related fatalities involve incidents of Halloween celebrants dying after putting their necks into decorative nooses that had no harnesses or other protective mechanisms to prevent accidental choking. The Associated Press reported such a fatal hanging accident in October 2001, this one involving a 14-year-old boy named Caleb Rebh who was working a \"haunted hayride\" attraction at Alpine Ridge Farms in Sparta, Michigan. According to reports, Rebh \"felt awkward simply jumping out of the woods to scare passers-by\" and decided to take the place of a skeleton that was hanging by a noose in a nearby tree: Caleb put the noose around his neck but when he let go of the rope, he apparently was not heavy enough to prevent the branch from whipping back up and choking him, his mother said. When he started scrambling to get the double-knotted rope off his neck, fellow workers seemed to think he was acting, she said. \"I think he thought he was safe because his feet were touching the ground,\" Kathy Rebh said. Hayride employees and participants tried to resuscitate Caleb, but he was pronounced dead at the scene. In September 2013, a Kentucky teenager died in similar fashion after prankishly inserting his neck into a decorative noose he had put up in his home's front yard as part of a Halloween display: Jordan Morlan, 16, died after a prank involving his love of Halloween went horribly wrong. Morlan had been hanging Halloween decorations all day and had just returned home from helping his mom do laundry when the tragedy occurred. Jordan's mom, Ginger Rodriguez, said he was trying to prank his little sister and her by pretending to be hanging from a noose decoration he put up on a tree in their front yard. The coroner said when he placed the noose around his neck, he became disoriented cutting his brain off from oxygen within 20 to30 seconds. His younger sister discovered him unconscious and Rodriguez rushed to help cut him down, but said she was unable to remove her son. Morlan was taken to the hospital where he was placed on a ventilator because he was in a coma. Rodriguez says her son's organs started to fail. Jordan died 12 hours after this accident.

"Barbara Mikkelson" 1999-07-11 "A woman intent upon looking her best for a big day treats herself to far too many tanning sessions and cooks herself to death." "Claim: A woman intent upon looking her best for a big day treats herself to far too many tanning sessions and cooks herself to death. Status: False. Examples:  A young woman was getting married and she wanted to look her very best. She decided that her expensive white dress would be attractively set off by a golden tan. Unfortunately, she waited until a week before the wedding to start her tanning sessions. Salon after salon told her that she could only tan for thirty minutes, twice a week, to start. At this rate, she would not be tan in time for her wedding. The bride then had a brilliant idea: she would tan the maximum amount of time at every tanning salon in town. The wedding day came, and the bride was beautiful — dark, perfect tan and all. However, on the wedding night, the groom noticed that his new wife had a peculiar smell — kind of like rotting meat. As the honeymoon wore on, the smell persisted and grew worse until he could stand it no longer: he insisted that his bride go to the hospital to find out what was causing the awful stench. Doctors examined her carefully, but could not identify the source of the odor. The bride's health began to fail, and after a few days she died. When the autopsy was performed, the horrified coroner discovered that the woman's internal organs were cooked! Over-exposure to tanning rays had cooked the woman from the inside out, just like a microwave oven, and in the days following the wedding, the bride had begun to \"spoil\".
 
 [Collected on the Internet, 1998] When I was a student at UCLA I heard a story going around campus that a sorority girl had died the previous week. Evidently, she was getting ready for a formal function between her sorority and a fraternity. She wanted to look her best, which she believed included a tanned complexion. As the story went, she spent Thursday and Friday going from tanning salon to tanning salon, only leaving a salon when the management refused to let her stay any longer for safety reasons. She achieved the complexion she wanted and attended the formal function Friday night. The next morning, her horrified sorority sisters found her in bed, dead. A subsequent autopsy revealed that she had literally \"cooked\" her internal organs.
 Variations:
    Origins: Back  in mid-1987, this was the hottest story going. It seemingly erupted out of nowhere, in the way urban legends often do. The same tale, with countless variations of detail, was on everybody's lips. In the story, ultraviolet rays are confused with the microwaves used in cooking. Tanning — naturally or by way of sun lamps or tanning beds — isn't all that sensible a thing to do. Dangers include skin cancer, skin and eye burns, and cataracts. It's a perilous vanity. But its perils do not extend to cooking people the way a microwave would. UV rays just don't imitate microwaves, a fact this legend completely ignores. Despite the impossibility of the account, the hunt for the broiled girl was on. Even advice columnist Abigail Van Buren was drawn into the search: Dear Abby: I just received a letter from my daughter, Kathy, who is attending school in Provo, Utah. She related the following story that I found so horrifying, I want to share it with you so that you can warn others. \"A 17-year-old girl won a trip to Hawaii. She wanted a really nice tan for the trip, so last week she went to a tanning parlor. She'd never been to one before, so she asked how long was the maximum time she could stay in, and they said half an hour. Well, she wanted a really dark tan, fast, so she went to seven places and spent a half-hour in each — three and a half hours total! Well, this poor girl is now in Utah Valley Regional Medical Center. They estimate she has about 26 days to live. She's totally blind, and they say it's as if she had 'microwaved' herself — it's basically the same principle. Anyhow, she just cooked herself from the inside out. And the worst part is, there's not a thing they can do for her. Not a thing. Her poor family!\" Of course, the girl was foolish. But most of us do things that are foolish sometime in our lives, but we live to laugh about them. This girl will not. Please warn your readers, Abby. You may want to verify these facts on Provo. — Anita Hallock Dear Anita: Thanks for writing. I wondered how \"they\" could estimate the number of days \"this poor girl\" had to live, so I called the Utah Valley Regional Medical Center in Provo and its spokesperson, Mr. Clark Cares, stated that there was no such person in the facility, but that the story had been circulating at the Brigham Young University. Joann, secretary to the medical director, said that she had just returned from Pocatello, Idaho, where she had heard the same story. In checking with The Provo DailyHerald, Rene Nelson told my staff that they had also heard the rumor, but were unable to confirm it. Well, friends, so much for the \"tanning\" story. \"A 17-year-old girl won a trip to Hawaii. She wanted a really nice tan for the trip, so last week she went to a tanning parlor.

 The broiled girl myth spread far and wide in the early days of the legend when tanning salons were all the rage. Surprisingly, even in these more health-conscious times, the tale continues to do the rounds. Possibly what started out as a mistrust of new technology legend has shifted focus to become an expression of a health truism: Stay pale and stay healthy. It's no longer the technology we fear, it's getting the tan! All lore aside, there has been one tanning booth death, but it came about as a freak reaction to a drug the victim was taking, not because she overindulged in the number and duration of recommended tanning sessions. On 24 May 1989, Patsy Campbell of Portage, Indiana, died at the University of Chicago Medical Center of burns suffered in a 25-minute tanning booth session 11 days earlier. Burns covered 70% of her body. Campbell had been taking Psoralen, a drug used to increase the skin's sensitivity to light as part of a program to treat psoriasis. Soon after visiting the parlor, she began to itch all over, and blisters formed two days later. Dr. Alan Dimick, a burn expert from the University of Alabama, said it was the first verifiable case of fatal burns suffered in a tanning booth. Notice that he made that statement about a case two years after the broiled bridesmaid tale was kicking around. In 2007 the case of an Australian woman's battle against skin cancer brought into question the need for regulation of the use of tanning beds. 26-year-old Clare Oliver said when she was 19 she took up a local salon's offer for twenty tanning sessions for the price of ten, with deadly results. Following the advice of the solarium staff, she partook of tanning sessions every second day. The young woman was diagnosed with melanoma when she was 22, and the disease took her life on 13 September 2007. Associate Professor Grant McArthur, from the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, says of solariums, \"They deliver five times the dose of UV radiation than the midday sun. They are also clearly linked to increased rates of skin cancer.\" Tales like the broiled bride are our way of expressing distrust of modern technology and warning against the dangers of product misuse, not to mention highlighting the pitfalls of excessive vanity. As stated earlier, it's possible our reason for passing along the legend has changed to reflect the climate of our times, with the story having now become more about the perils of sunbathing than about scary, unfamiliar technology.

"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/alligators-sewers/" "false" "It's amazing what a little digging will uncover." "Barbara Mikkelson" 1999-07-10 "A thriving colony of large alligators lives deep within the bowels of the New York City sewer system." "It's long been rumored there are thriving colonies of alligators lurking in New York City's sewer system. Supposedly, baby alligators brought back as pets from Florida end up being dumped into the sewer system when they outgrow their young and innocent stage. From such an inglorious beginning, these discarded gators grow to immense size and daily terrorize all those foolish enough to risk a visit to the bowels of the city. <!----> We've all heard it. And it ain't true. It's amazing who believes in those invisible alligators too. As the Director of the New York Sea Grant Institute in Albany) said to The New York Times in 1982: \"No less a source than All the New That's Fit to Print reported a veritable rash of 'saurian sightings' in the city sewers through the 1930's.\" You know, if you stopped right there, you might walk away from all this convinced there are alligators down there. But it's amazing what a little digging will uncover (or, in this case, not uncover). Figuring any \"alligators in our sewers!\" story would be considered newsworthy by the New York press, I went through The New York Times index from 1905 to 1993 in search of alligator stories. Then I located each story on microfilm. Here's a summary of what I found: All these alligators found in and around New York City, but only one had turned up in a sewer. (Mind you, Westchester County looks like a fine place to avoid if you're not saurianly inclined — every second gator story seemed to come from there.) Not surprising either, for alligators thrive in Florida and it's hard to believe creatures that accustomed to a warm climate would survive in the NY sewer system. A New York winter is hard on native New Yorkers; I wouldn't think a colony of gators would stand a chance in that cold. Nature writer Diane Ackerman has this to say about alligators' longevity under those conditions: But they couldn't survive for any length of time in the sewers, only a few months at the most, because they can't live long in salmonella or shigella or E. coli, organisms that one usually finds in sewage. Also, alligators live at temperatures between 78 and 90 degrees . . . Despite the dearth of news stories about NY alligators and in the face of what we know about how gators are put together, the \"alligators in the New York sewer system\" stories persist. Most of the blame for this tale's persistence should be assigned to Robert Daley's 1959 World Beneath The City. In it, Daley passes along a tale from Teddy May, New York's superintendent of sewers until 1955. According to the book, sewer inspectors first reported seeing gators around 1935, but May did not believe them. He went himself into the sewers and afterwards: He sat at his desk screwing his fists into his eyes, trying to forget the sight of alligators serenely paddling around in his sewers. The beam of his own flashlight had spotted alligators whose length, on the average, was about two feet . . . The colony appeared to have settled contentedly under the very streets of the busiest city in the world. According to that book, these alligators were dispatched by various means including being poisoned, shot, or herded into the trunk mains where currents washed them out to sea.
<!----> This massive alligator hunt wasn't reported in the popular press, yet as we've seen, The New York Times will publish just about anything that has to do with alligators in or around New York. As well, World Beneath The City doesn't give a date for the supposed occurrence; all it says is Teddy May first heard gator reports in 1935. The date of his visit to the sewers or the extermination of the alligators is not provided. Daley spoke to May in 1959 (when May was 84 years old and 20-odd years after the alligators were supposedly discovered and dispatched down there). The details are a bit too fuzzy and there's a decided lack of outside confirmation. May's story is best regarded as a fanciful tale. As for how seriously to take May, according to a 1992 magazine article, \" . . . a sewer official told [folklorist Jan Harold] Brunvand that Teddy May was 'almost as much of a legend as the alligators,' a spinner of colorful yarns.\" Each year at least half a dozen people ask New York City's Bureau of Sewers about those infamous gators. John T. Flaherty (Chief of Design) answers these inquiries routinely. I could cite you many cogent, logical reasons why the sewer system is not a fit habitat for an alligator, but suffice it to say that, in the 28 years I have been in the sewer game, neither I nor any of the thousands of men who have worked to build, maintain or repair the sewer system has ever seen one. Flaherty (whose sense of humor is of the dry yet deadly variety) added the one clear proof of the absence of alligators — not a single union official has ever advanced alligator infestation as a reason for a pay increase for sewer workers. Even though it's next to impossible to prove something didn't happen, I would still suggest from the lack of credible sightings it's safe to assume there are no alligators down there. The tall tale about thriving colonies of alligators lurking in New York's sewers finds an antecedent in another (at that time, at least) widely believed tale recorded in 1851 about feral pigs or hogs infesting the sewers in Hampstead [London]: There is a strange tale in existence among the shore-workers, of a race of wild hogs inhabiting the sewers in the neighbourhood of Hampstead. The story runs, that a sow in young, by some accident got down the sewer through an opening, and, wandering away from the spot, littered and reared her offspring in the drain, feeding on the offal and garbage washed into it continually. Here, it is alleged, the breed multiplied exceedingly, and have become almost as ferocious as they are numerous.This story, apocryphal as it seems, has nevertheless its believers, and it is ingeniously argued, that the reason why none of the subterranean animals have been able to make their way to the light of day is, that they could only do so by reaching the mouth of the sewer at the river-side, while, in order to arrive at that point, they must necessarily encounter the Fleet ditch, which runs towards the river with great rapidity, and as it is the obstinate nature of a pig to swim against the stream, the wild hogs of the sewers invariably work their way back to their original quarters, and are thus never to be seen. What seems strange in the matter is, that the inhabitants of Hampstead never have been known to see any of these animals pass beneath the gratings, nor to have been disturbed by their gruntings. The reader of course can believe as much of the story as he pleases, and it is right to inform him that the sewerhunters themselves have never yet encountered any of the fabulous monsters of the Hampstead sewers. As a suitable finale, I present excerpts from a 1932 New York Times about police plans to stalk alligators they believed were living in a Bronx River lair: . . . two small boys had appeared at headquarters last night to show the chief a dead alligator, about 36 inches long, which they said they had captured along the shore of the lake. The boys told the chief that the Bronx River, of which the lake is a part, had been 'swarming' with at least two or three other alligators.The start of the explorers was delayed today because of fear on the part of the police chief that a species of human beings, known as baseball players, who congregate on the shores of the lake, would interfere with the expedition. The proper method of catching an alligator alive was the subject of a conference this afternoon between the police chief and his men. [. . .] Some one suggested that one of the police explorers, who sings bass in the police quartet, ought to practice the alligator mating call, which the police chief learned was a cross between the bark of a dog and the grunt of a pig. A hurried visitor to Police Headquarters told the police chief that a piece of liver would make an alligator literally walk across the water to shore and that it could be captured alive easily with the type of net generally used by butterfly chasers. The police chief put in a requisition for enough liver to feed a good-sized alligator, and one of his men promised to lend the explorers a fishing net for the expedition.

"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/chicken-sandwich-tumor/" "false" "\"It turns out that the piece of chicken contained a tumor, and when the woman bit into it it exploded, releasing some kind of pus-like substance.\"" "Barbara Mikkelson" 1999-07-05 "The mayonnaise oozing from a chicken sandwich turned out to be pus from a tumor in the chicken." "A particularly yucky food tale from the early 1990s was a favorite of high school and college students and said a lot about how we feel about fast food: A woman goes into a fast food restaurant and orders a chicken sandwich with no mayo. She bites into it, tastes some kind of sauce, and looking at her sandwich, realizes that it looks kinda like mayonnaise. She takes it back to the counter where they insist that there was no mayo on the sandwich. Eventually, it turns out that the piece of chicken contained a tumor, and when the woman bit into it it exploded, releasing some kind of pus-like substance. This tale was spread in many variant forms:                           Unlike most contaminated food stories, this one couldn't have happened as told. Fast food chicken sandwiches are made of chopped, processed meat: chicken is ground then reformed into breast-shaped patties. Even those sandwiches fabricated from whole chicken breast couldn't possibly come through the preparation process with a pus-filled abscess intact, as the meat has to be pounded to spread it out to fit the bun, and to stop it from curving up in the middle the way an unmanipulated chicken breast would (which would make piling on the fixings that much harder). And then there's frying process — no pus-filled anything is going to survive that. Not only is this a legend about what yucky things might be lurking in our fast food, it's also a tale that dredges up the specter of cancer. (In the vast majority of tellings a tumor is discovered in the chicken sandwich, not an abscess or a cyst. This, by the way, also eliminates any remaining credibility the story might have, for tumors are hard masses of cancerous flesh without pus.) The apocryphal discovery of a tumorous chicken breast in a fast food sandwich is a way of expressing distrust about the nature of food in this advanced age. Are chickens being force-fed chemicals to make them grow faster and bigger and so reach our dinner plates sooner? (In truth, they aren't.) Are we happy about that? The moral of this legend is that you get out what you put in: feed a chicken chemicals and end up with tumorous meat." 1999 "Jul" 7 NA

"Barbara Mikkelson" 1999-06-12 "A vacationing couple staying in a foul-smelling motel room discovered a body hidden under their bed." "In his urban legend book The Baby Train, folklorist Jan Harold Brunvand writes that he first heard the \"dead body found under hotel bed\" legend in 1991. Every version that came to him mentioned a Las Vegas hotel, but the lack of checkable details led him to believe this was an apocryphal tale. Okay, so we can date the appearance of this legend to 1991. Unlike a number of other such gruesome tales, this legend appears to have sprung from a misremembering of any one of a number of actual news items, with the talebearer shifting certain details so that deaths which took place in anonymous little motels along Interstates are said to have happened in Las Vegas, America's own Sin City, and victims who'd (usually) done little else amiss than be in the wrong place at the wrong time and/or take up with questionable company were transformed through the magic of retelling into prostitutes. Dead bodies get stashed in the box spring or the bed's pedestal more often than you'd want to believe. What's more, a fair number of them are only discovered days later ...after the new tenant complains about a persistent and disagreeable odor. In each of the following cases not only were bodies discovered under hotel beds, but it was investigations of the smell of decomposition that led to their discoveries.  On 10 July 2003, a man checked into the Capri Motel, just east of downtown Kansas City, and began complaining about a foul odor in his room. Management told him nothing could be done about the problem, and he spent three nights in his room before checking out because he could no longer stand the smell. When the cleaning staff came in to make up the room on 13 July, they lifted the mattress and underneath found a man's body in an advanced stage of decomposition. On 10 June 1999 the rapidly decomposing remains of 64-year-old Saul Hernandez were discovered inside the bed in Room 112 at the Burgundy Motor Inn in Atlantic City, New Jersey. A German couple had spent the night sleeping over Hernandez's remains, and it was their complaint to the manager about the smell in their room which led to the discovery of the corpse. In July 1996 a woman's body was found under a mattress in the Colorado Boulevard Travelodge in Pasadena, CA. Apparently the motel's staff discovered her ten days after her demise and only after guests had complained for several days of a foul odor coming from that room. There were two stashed-and-smelly body cases in Florida in 1994. (Further adding to the confusability of these stories' taking place in the same year and the same state, in both instances the next tenants those rooms had were German tourists.) In August 1994 in Fort Lauderdale, hotel staff discovered the body of 47-year-old Bryan Gregory tucked under a platform bed. Though the staff had themselves noticed the strange smell for days, they only set about looking for its source after a German couple spent the night in that room and afterwards complained about the odor. In March 1994 the body of 24-year-old Josefina Martinez was found underneath a bed at the Traveler's Hotel near Miami International Airport. Again, the discovery was prompted by an aggrieved German tourist upset about a foul odor in his room. In Virginia in 1989, Jerry Lee Dunbar disposed of the remains of two victims this way: 27-year-old Deirdre Smith, who was discovered in May under the floor of a motel room on Route 1, and 29-year-old Marilyn Graham, who turned up in June under a bed in the Alexandria Econo Lodge. In Smith's case, the killer first kept her body partially hidden under his bed for two days, then subsequently placed it in the crawl space under the carpeted floor. Her presence seemingly didn't bother him, because he didn't move out of that room until three or four weeks later. Both girls' bodies were eventually found after other guests complained about the stink. In Mineola, New York, motel in 1988, a body turned up in a box spring. The remains of 29-year-old Mary Jean DeOliviera were found at the Oceanside Motel. Again, the body was discovered days later and only after other patrons complained about the smell. At least two other guests unknowingly cohabited with the body before it was found, and at least one guest refused to stay in that room because of the smell. Here's a change of pace — not a murder, but a death by misadventure. In Rosedale, Maryland in 1987, an unidentified man died of a drug overdose after one of the thirty-four balloons of heroin he'd swallowed burst. His partner stashed the corpse under their motel bed, then split. Three days later, the family the room was next rented to complained about the odor, and this led to the body's discovery. One of the oldest \"smelly body left under the bed\" sightings comes from 1982. Richard Kuklinski, Daniel Deppner, and Gary Smith often teamed together to run auto theft scams. Kuklinski and Deppner decided to kill Smith, and they accomplished this by feeding him a cyanide-laced hamburger in a North Bergen, New Jersey, motel room. Kuklinkski finished off Smith by strangling him when watching Smith die of poisoning proved tiresome. Smith's body was stuffed under the bed and left there. It was found four days later, on 27 December 1982. During the intervening four days, the room had been rented to others each night. Guests had wrinkled their noses at the smell, but none thought to look under the bed. That case has seemingly been topped by one in which Sony Millbrook of Memphis, Tennessee, was reported missing on 27 January 2010 after she failed to pick up her children from school. Forty-seven days later, on 15 March 2010, homicide investigators were called to the room of a Budget Inn motel where Millbrook had been living just prior to her disappearance, her body having just been discovered inside the frame of the bed there — even though the room had reportedly been cleaned and rented several times since her disappearance almost seven weeks earlier. There are, of course, numerous other cases of dead bodies being left under hotel beds, but I've chosen not to report on these because they lack the key element of the legend: complaints about the presence of a horrific smell leading to the corpse's discovery. What gives this urban legend its chills-down-the-spine gruesomeness is the body's being found only after an unsuspecting traveler spends the night sleeping above it. That clearly happened in at least some of the cases mentioned here (and perhaps in others where the news reports stated only that hotel guests had complained without specifying which guests). Urban legends tend to localize to where we believe they likely would have happened. It's easy to understand how in each of the versions Brunvand related that Las Vegas was always named as the city where the corpse reposed, for Vegas is indeed viewed as Sin City, USA. Much easier to believe that the unsuspecting traveler shared his room with a moldering corpse in Las Vegas than it is to (rightly) place that occurrence in small-town New York, Virginia, or Maryland. Especially when dealing with a half-remembered true story, it's natural for the \"obvious\" details to replace facts that have been misplaced due to ordinary fuzziness of memory. One, after all, does not let a lack of certainty stand in the way of a good story. Keep in mind that the Deirdre Smith (1989, Virginia), Marilyn Graham (1989, Virginia), Mary Jean DeOliviera (1988, New York), John Doe (1987, Maryland), and Gary Smith (1982, New York) cases antedate 1991. Gruesome finds like those tend to get heavily reported on, and that certainly happened with Smith, Graham and DeOliviera (the cites below don't begin to do justice to the coverage these discoveries got — they were reported on by a double handful of various papers across the USA). It is because of that widespread coverage that I lean towards this legend's having sprung to life out of a true story whose location got shifted from Your Town, USA (where only nice people live) to Sin City (where life and room rates are cheap). Sightings: Look for this legend in the 1995 film Four Rooms. This legend was also the subject of a July 2014 fake news article." 1999 "Jun" 6 1980

"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/just-dying-to-get-out/" "true" "And could it still happen?" "Barbara Mikkelson" 1999-06-09 "People have been buried alive by mistake." "Don't quit your shuddering just yet. Live burial is not unheard of; it has always been a real (albeit distant) possibility. Indeed, it's conceivable the first burials of humans were accidental, live ones: Ill and wounded hunters were left in caves with the entrances sealed off to keep out wild animals while the rest of the hunting parties continued after their prey. It was hoped that once the victims had regained their strength, they would push the barriers out of the way and rejoin the group. Some died in those caves, however Example: [Percy Russell, 1906] PREMATURE BURIAL To die is natural; but the living death
Of those who waken into consciousness,
Though for a moment only, ay, or less,
To find a coffin stifling their last breath,
Surpasses every horror underneath
The sun of Heaven, and should surely check
Haste in the living to remove the wreck
Of what was just before, the soul's fair sheath,
How many have been smothered in their shroud!
How many have sustained this awful woe!
Humanity would shudder could we know
How many have cried to God in anguish loud,
Accusing those whose haste a wrong had wrought
Beyond the worst that ever devil thought. The still-living have been consigned to an eternal dirt nap often enough that fears of premature burial are based on fact as much as on lore. Numerous cases of interments and almost interments dot history. In the first century, the magician Simon Magus, according to one report, buried himself alive, expecting a miracle — a miracle that didn't happen. On Iona, in the sixth century, one of St. Columba's monks, Oran, was dug up the day after his burial and found to be alive. Legend has it when he told his fellows he had seen heaven and hell, he was promptly dispatched and re-interred on grounds of heresy. And the 13th-century Thomas a Kempis, the reputed author of the great devotional work The Imitation of Christ, was never made a saint because, it was said, when they dug up his body for the ossuary they found scratch marks on the lid of his coffin and concluded that he was not reconciled to his fate. In the late 16th century, the body of Matthew Wall was being borne to his grave in Braughing, England. One of the pallbearers tripped, causing the others to drop the coffin, thus reviving the dear departed. Wall lived on for several more years, dying in 1595. He celebrated his 'resurrection' every year. In the early 17th century, Marjorie Elphinstone died and was buried in Ardtannies, Scotland. When grave robbers attempted to steal the jewelry interred with her, the deceased surprised the heck out of them by groaning. The robbers fled for their lives, and Elphinstone revived, walked home, and outlived her husband by six years. Marjorie Halcrow Erskine of Chirnside, Scotland, died in 1674 and was buried in a shallow grave by a sexton intent upon returning later to steal her jewelry. While the light-fingered sexton was trying to cut off her finger to retrieve a ring, she awoke. In her additional years of life after her first burial, she went on to give birth to and raise two sons. No one knows what happened to the sexton. The 17th century saw a number of premature burials. Collapse and apparent death were not uncommon during epidemics of plague, cholera, and smallpox. From contemporary medical sources, William Tebb compiled 219 instances of narrow escape from premature burial, 149 cases of actual premature burial, 10 cases in which bodies were accidentally dissected before death, and 2 cases in which embalming was started on the not-yet-dead. Some instances were especially heartbreaking. In the 1850s, a young girl visiting Edisto Island, South Carolina, died of diphtheria. She was quickly interred in a local family's mausoleum because it was feared the disease might otherwise spread. When one of the family's sons died in the Civil War, the tomb was opened to admit him. A tiny skeleton was found on the floor just behind the door. [British Medical Journal, 1877] A correspondent at Naples states that the Appeals Court has had before it a case not likely to inspire confidence in the minds of those who look forward with horror to the possibility of being buried alive. It appeared from the evidence that some time ago, a woman was interred with all the usual formalities, it being believed that she was dead, while she was only in a trance. Some days afterwards, when the grave in which she had been placed was opened for the reception of another body, it was found that the clothes which covered the unfortunate woman were torn to pieces, and that she had even broken her limbs in attempting to extricate herself from the living tomb. The Court, after hearing the case, sentenced the doctor who had signed the certificate of decease, and the Major who had authorized the interment each to three month's imprisonment for involuntary manslaughter. A recent \"not quite all the way over the line yet\" news story comes from 1993: Sipho William Mdletshe might as well be dead, as far as his fiancee is concerned. Declared deceased after a traffic accident in Johannesburg, South Africa, Mdletshe, 24, spent two days in a metal box in a mortuary before his cries alerted workers, who rescued him. But Mdletshe is heartbroken, because his fiancee, who also was hurt in the crash, doesn't believe his story and refuses to see him. She thinks he's a zombie who returned from the dead to haunt her. In 1994, 86-year-old Mildred C. Clarke spent ninety minutes in a body bag in the morgue at the Albany Medical Center Hospital before an attendant noticed the bag was breathing. She'd been found sprawled on her living room floor, cold and motionless, with no detectable heartbeat, breath, or other signs of life. She was also as stiff as a board. The coroner didn't have to think twice about declaring her dead. She apparently did not agree with his verdict, and, with care, lived a week longer. Okay, so it happens. But how common an occurrence is it? In 1896, T.M. Montgomery, who supervised the disinterment and moving of the remains at the Fort Randall Cemetery, reported that \"nearly 2% of those exhumed were no doubt victims of suspended animation.\" These days, getting accidentally buried alive in the United States or Canada borders on the impossible. Embalming procedures will finish off anyone not quite all the way through the Pearly Gates, and the families of deceased citizens of both those countries overwhelmingly opt to have their loved ones embalmed. (Contrary to popular belief, embalming is not mandatory in the United States. Corpses carry little disease risk — we pose a much greater threat to the public health while we're still breathing, bleeding, and shedding skin. Proof of this lack of danger is found in the Centers for Disease Control's study into the risk factors inherent to workers in the funeral business — they found those who deal with cadavers have no greater mortality rate than the general population, nor does their occupation appear to hold special danger of infection. Moreover, despite the claims of the funeral industry, normal embalming does not kill all disease-causing organisms in a cadaver. One study found common pathogens (including the tuberculosis bacillus) still present in 22 of 23 cadavers within 24 to 48 hours of embalming. Other infectious organisms are virtually unaffected by normal embalming, including those that cause anthrax, tetanus and gas gangrene.) There have been deaths by embalming. In 1837, Cardinal Somaglia was taken ill, passed out, and was thought to have died. Preparations were begun immediately to embalm this very important church official. When the surgeon/embalmer cut into the chest to instill embalming materials, he could see the cardinal's heart still beating. Worse, at this point, the cardinal awoke from his stupor and wisely pushed the knife away from his chest. His effort was to no avail, though — the chest incision killed him. Sometimes the presumed corpse's 'still living' status is only discovered when someone sets about to perform a post-mortem. A 1996 newspaper article reports: In 1984, a post-mortem examination was being conducted in a mortuary in New York. When the pathologist made the first cut the \"corpse\" leaped up and grabbed him by the throat. The pathologist died of shock.The case of Daphne Banks, who was pronounced dead on New Year's Eve [1995] but showed signs of life when she got to the mortuary, is by no means unique. From the time of Plato to the present there are many well-documented accounts of the dead coming back to life. The Reverend Schwartz, a missionary, was brought back to life by hearing his favourite hymn played at his funeral. The mourners were surprised to hear his voice from the coffin joining in the singing. Nicephorus Glycas, the Greek Orthodox Bishop of Lesbos, laid in state in his church for two days while mourners filed past his coffin. Suddenly he sat up and demanded to know what everybody was looking at. The discovery that a corpse still has some life left in him isn't a new phenomenon: [Stowe's Annals, 1587] The 20 of Februarie [1587], a strange thing happened to a man hanged for felonie at Saint Thomas Waterines, being begged by the Chirugeons of London, to have made of him an anatomie, after he was dead to all men's thinking, cut downe, throwne into a carre, and so brought from the place of execution through the Borough of Southwarke over the bridge, and through the Citie of London to the Chirugeons Hall nere unto Cripelgate: The chest being opened there, and the weather extreme cold hee was found to be alive, and lived till three and twentie of Februarie, and then died. One of the most famous of such cases is that of Anne Greene who, after being hanged for a felony on 14 December 1650, was sent to the anatomy hall to be used for dissection. She awoke and lived on for many years afterwards. Rapist-murderer William Duell was hanged at Tyburn in November 1740 and taken for dissection. The assistant noted the deceased was breathing and had a faint pulse. Although he was in great pain, two hours later the dead man was sitting in a chair drinking wine. He was sent back to prison and later exiled for life. Around the same time, Professor Junkur of Halle University received a sack with the body of a hanged criminal to be used for dissection. The body was dumped in his house after dark when the professor had already gone to bed. During the night, the professor was awakened by the figure of a naked and shivering man holding an empty sack. The professor decided to help the man escape further punishment and some years later encountered him on the street, a wealthy merchant with a wife and two children. Not every anatomist was so kind-hearted. The Newgate Calendar quoted the surgeon who worked on an eighteenth century German criminal as saying: I am pretty certain, gentlemen, from the warmth of the subject and the flexibility of the limbs, that by a proper degree of attention and care the vital heat would return, and life in consequence take place. But when it is considered what a rascal we should again have among us, that he was hanged for so cruel a murder, and that, should we restore him to life, he would probably kill somebody else. I say, gentlemen, all these things considered, it is my opinion that we had better proceed in the dissection. Okay, so it was (and still is) possible to be buried alive or to meet your maker on a post-mortem table. The prospect is chilling, and numerous people have gone to great lengths to make sure it doesn't happen to them. The practice of 'waking' the dead (having someone sit with the deceased from the time of death until burial in case he 'wakes up') began out of this concern. Especially in bygone days when a number of illnesses could cause the sufferer to slip into a coma and thus make it appear all life functions had been snuffed out, the danger of overly hasty interment was real. (Edgar Allan Poe's macabre short stories, most notably \"Premature Burial,\" certainly helped increase such fears among the general populace.) Some went so far as to specify in their wills they wanted special tests performed on their bodies to make sure they were actually dead. Surgical incisions, the application of boiling hot liquids, touching red-hot irons to their flesh, stabbing them through the heart, or even decapitating them were all specified at different times as a way of making sure they didn't wake up six feet under. Some opted for being buried with the means to do themselves in, and guns, knives, and poison were packed into coffins along with the deceased. The screams of a young Belgian girl who came out of a trance-like state as the earth fell on her coffin so upset Count Karnice-Karnicki, Chamberlain to the Czar and Doctor of the Law Faculty of the University of Louvain, that he invented a coffin which allowed a person accidentally buried alive to summon help through a system of flags and bells. Patented in 1897, this hermetically-sealed coffin had a tube, about 3.5 inches in diameter, extending to a box on the surface. The tube was attached to a spring-loaded ball sitting on the corpse's chest. Any movement of the chest would release the spring, opening the box lid and admitting light and air into the coffin. To signal for help, a flag would spring up, a bell would ring for half an hour, and a lamp would burn after sunset. Similar \"life-signaling\" coffins were patented in the United States. Those old-fashioned devices might sound quaint and out of place in modern society, but concern over live burial has prompted the redirection of newer technologies to take the place of red flags and whistles:  Evangelist Mary Baker Eddy has long been rumored to have been interred along with a functioning telephone. That bit of popular lore likely grew out of a misremembering of the circumstances of her burial. After she died at her home in Boston, in December 1910, her body was kept at the general receiving vault at Mount Auburn Cemetery in nearby Cambridge for several months while her monument was being constructed. Because she was a world renowned figure and there was some fear of thievery, a guard was hired to stay with the body until it was interred and the tomb sealed, and a telephone was installed at the receiving vault for his use during that period. There was never a phone at the monument, inside or outside. The same rumor is associated with Aimee Semple McPherson, another famous evangelist. She was buried in 1944 in Los Angeles' Forest Lawn Memorial Park. McPherson used a telephone on the stage of her Angeles Temple to keep in contact with her radio crew during sermons, and this may have contributed to the rumor. More likely, people confused her with Mary Baker Eddy. In 1995 a $5,000 Italian casket equipped with call-for-help ability and survival kit went on sale. Akin to beeping devices which alert relatives to an elderly family member's being in trouble, this casket is equipped with a beeper which will sound a similar emergency signal. The coffins are also fitted with a two-way microphone/speaker to enable communication between the occupant and someone outside, and a kit which includes a torch, a small oxygen tank, a sensor to detect a person's heartbeat, and even a heart stimulator. Those worried about premature burial would do well to consider Point #10 of \"Short Reasons for Cremation,\" a 12-point pamphlet circulated in Australia at the turn of the century: Cremation eliminates all danger of being buried alive. History does record some instances of deliberate live burial. It was a method of execution employed in Roman times for vestal virgins who broke their vows of chastity, and some medieval monks and nuns were also thus punished for the same crime. Plutarch described the process for vestal virgins: . . . a narrow room is constructed, to which a descent is made by stairs; here they prepare a bed, and light a lamp, and leave a small quantity of victuals, such as bread and water, a pail of milk, and some oil; so that body which had been consecrated and devoted to the most sacred service of religion might not be said to perish by such a death as famine. The culprit herself is put in a litter, which they cover over, and tie her down with cords on it, so that nothing she utters may be heard. They then take her to the Forum... When they come to the place of execution, the officers loose the cords, and then the high priest, lifting his hands to heaven, pronounces certains prayers to himself before the act; then he brings out the prisoner, being still covered, and placing her upon the steps that lead down to the cell, turns away his face ... the stairs are drawn up after she has gone down, and a quantity of earth is heaped up over the entrance to the cell ... This is the punishment of those who break their vows of virginity. Medieval monks and nuns who broke their vows of chastity were often walled into small niches, just barely large enough for their bodies. They also were given a pittance of food and water, and the grim benediction Vade in Pacem (Depart in Peace). Some have been buried alive to serve the dead in the next life. In Africa, for example, two live slaves (a man and a woman) were interred with each dead Wadoe headman. The man was given a bill-hook to use to cut wood for fuel in the next life, and the woman cradled the dead chief's head in her lap. In 1849, an observer at the funeral of King Thien Tri of Cochin, China, reported that along with rich and plentiful grave goods, all of the king's childless wives were entombed with his body, thus guaranteeing he'd be henpecked throughout eternity but would at least get his meals on time." 1999 "Jun" 6 1580

"Barbara Mikkelson" 1999-05-30 "A motorcyclist comes to an untimely end when he chooses to \"thread the needle\" by driving between two oncoming bikes." "Claim: A motorcyclist comes to an untimely end when he chooses to \"thread the needle\" by driving between two oncoming bikes. LEGEND Examples:  A friend of my uncle is a retired carpenter who lives up on the edge of the Pennines. He drove a lovely old polished Rover of an evening and regularly toured up to his local in the hills where they don't know the meaning of closing time. The bloke didn't overindulge, and usually left just before eleven. But practically every night as he drove back along an unlit and particularly winding stretch of road, two grebos on monster bikes spitting horsepower would really put the willies up him. The huge greasers, headlights blazing, would take up the whole road, coming the opposite way. They blazed towards him with no thought for road safety, playing chicken and forcing him to swerve off the road and into hedges to avoid crashing. This situation went on for some time. Then one night, the bloke was driving back with a little more Dutch courage than usual coursing through his veins. He spotted the bikers a few bends ahead. Slamming his foot down, he hammered along the switchback road thinking this time he'd show them who's boss. He rounded the last corner into the glare of the bikers' two headlights and thundered for the gap between them — too late realising the headlights actually belonged to an articulated lorry.
 
 [Brunvand, 1987] Three motorcyclists on a long interstate trip. Long, lonely stretch of road, pitch-black moonless night. One rider gets a fair way ahead of his mates and decides to roar back with his light off, ride in between them and give them a fright. He sees the two motorcyclists' lights coming toward him and accelerates hard. Too late, he realizes that it's not his friends; they were passed by a car, which is now heading directly for him.
 Origins: This story was old news even back in 1987, when it was first written about by folklorist Jan Harold Brunvand. One of our readers remembered encountering it as a scary campfire tale back in the early 1970s; another heard it in the late 1950s or early 1960s from his father, who in turn recalled having heard it sometime during the 1930s. Yet another reader recollected its presentation in the 1960s as a joke: A motorcyclist is laid up in the hospital and is visited by his friends. They ask him what happened to him, and he replies that he had been motoring along a road at night and had seen two motorcyclists driving toward him, so he decided to ride between them as a stunt. \"But it wasn't two motorcycles; it was a damn Pierce-Arrow,\" the motorcyclist moaned.

the astute reader pointed out, the Pierce-Arrow was a pre-WWII car. More strikingly, it was one of the first to have headlights mounted on fenders rather than on each side of the center radiator housing, a change in design which appreciably widened the space between the lamps. A motorcyclist of that era could conceivably have mistaken an oncoming Pierce-Arrow for two motorcycles coming at him. At the very least, this change in design and the rider's unfamiliarity with it form the basis of a plausible-sounding joke. Joke, anecdote, or legend, the tale's message is clear: Wrong assumptions can kill you.

"Barbara Mikkelson" 1999-05-11 "A swelling on a girl's cheek breaks open and disgorges hundreds of baby spiders." "Claim: A swelling on a girl's cheek breaks open and disgorges hundreds of baby spiders. Status: False. Examples:  A woman well-known to our family friends was the travelling type, always hopping off to exotic places. One year, she set her heart on Guatemala in Central America. She went with an adventure holiday tour, which took people into the wild interior — lots of hacking through jungle with a machete and bivouacking overnight amidst the sounds of the rainforest. The woman was game and loved roughing it, so she wasn't at all fazed by all the creepie-crawlies everywhere, and had one of the best holidays she could remember. When she returned home to England, she noticed that a bite on her cheek she had sustained early on in the jungle had not healed up and was beginning to itch. She put some cream on it and thought no more about it. After a few days, however, the swelling had grown very bad indeed, and soon, despite applying various creams, the woman looked in the mirror and saw the whole cheek was red, itchy and inflamed. Finally, finding the irritation too much, the woman gave her cheek a really good scratch. At which the skin cracked, and hundreds of tiny spiders burst out, scattering away across her face.
 
 [Smith, 1986] A girl I know from Glasgow went on holiday with friends to the coast of North Africa — she had a terrific time. The only problem they had during the visit was on the last day when they had an invasion of small insects — particularly spiders. These appeared to have been blown out to the coast from the desert and all you could do was to keep brushing them away. In spite of this they managed to get a few hours sunbathing in, during which my friend was bitten on her face by the spiders a couple of times. Thinking no more about it, she simply applied an antiseptic cream to the bites and forgot them. By the time she had returned to Glasgow the bites were looking rather inflamed and beginning to look like boils. In spite of further treatment, they refused to subside so she eventually thought it best to arrange to visit the doctor the following day. Going to the bathroom the next morning she saw in the mirror that the bites looked even worse. She had just begun to carefully wash her face when she felt a sharp pricking sensation. Looking in the mirror again she was horrified and began to scream hysterically. The boils had burst and crawling all over her face and in her hair were hundreds of tiny baby spiders.
 Variations:
   Origins: According to oral lore, spiders have  been erupting from girl's cheeks since the mid-1960s. According to arachnid experts, no self respecting spider will lay its eggs on or in a human, a fact that roots this story squarely in the realm of lore. Yes, there are other insects and crawly things out there that will use an unsuspecting person as a creche. But not a spider. A likely antecedent to this legend is a 1842 Jeremias Gotthelf short story titled \"Die Schwarze Spinne.\" In it, a woman makes a pact with the Devil, which is sealed by his kiss on her cheek. When the Devil is cheated by villagers, a black boil begins to grow on the spot where he bussed her. It eventually bursts and venomous spiders crawl out of it. Though this is not a precise match, it shares enough elements in common with the legend in question (the victim is a woman, the lump grows noticeably before breaking open, the eruption occurs on her cheek, spiders come out of the opening) to be considered significant. At different times, spider eruption stories have skittered their way into the media. In 1998 in Britain, for example, a 30-year-old equities salesman just returned from a week in Mexico awoke to notice a bloody eruption on his right thigh. The doctor he consulted told him \"It is common to be bitten by spiders around here\" and \"It has probably laid eggs, so do not scratch.\" No spiders ever came out of the wound (how could they, after all?), but that didn't stop a number of those who had seen this story or its \"no spiders yet\" followup from remembering the reports quite differently. Memories of what they'd read changed over time, with a bulge on the man ballooning ever outward until it burst open, spewing deadly spiders everywhere even as tropical disease specialists stood helplessly by. Folklorists have classified this tale as a women's story, told primarily by women to women, because it reflects their disgust and revulsion towards insects and couples this reaction with a terror of anything happening to their looks. The location of the bite (on the cheek) is considered important in that not only do creepy-crawlies explode out of a human, but they ruin the person's face in the process. In the mind's eye, one sees not only the spiders bursting forth, but the gaping wound their frantic exit leaves behind.

"Barbara Mikkelson" 1999-05-02 "A girl goes insane after a medical student slips a cadaver's arm into her bed as a practical joke." "Claim: A girl goes insane after a medical student slips a cadaver's arm into her bed as a practical joke. LEGEND Examples:  This story took place in a hospital which was quite near Bowell, and concerned a nurse, called Jane in the story. For some reason Jane was unable to get along with the other nurses in the hospital, and was constantly quarrelling with people. They purposely did things to annoy her because they felt she deserved it. One night after Jane had been particularly trying, they decided to do something particularly unpleasant. One of the nurses on surgery duty agreed to bring an arm which had been amputated that day to Jane's room and slip it in her bed after she was asleep. They knew this would frighten her, but they thought perhaps it might force her to be more agreeable in the future. The arm was carefully and quietly put in the bed and Jane did not wake up. The next morning she did not appear, and no sound came from her room. The nurses, thinking she might be sick, went to investigate. They opened the door slowly and saw Jane sitting on the bed. Her hair, which had been black, was now completely white, and she was gnawing on the arm, making low gurgling noises all the while.
 
 [Smith, 1986] A group of medical students were bored and so they tried to think of ways of livening things up. Eventually one had the idea of \"borrowing\" a human foot from the dissecting laboratory and putting it in his girlfriend's bed as a joke. She was also a medical student staying at the same hall of residence. The students \"obtained\" a human foot, went up to the girl's room and put it in her bed. They thought it would be fun to hear her reactions so they hid round the corner and waited for her to come home. The student who had the key realised that he had left it in the door. However, before he could remove it the girl arrived back and, not thinking, unlocked the door with the key that was in the lock, took it in with her and locked the door on the other side. A few moments later they heard her screaming and crying out. They ran to the door and tried to open it but it was locked. They shouted to her that it was alright but she continued screaming hysterically. At this point they decided to break down the door. However, it took them a while and they were relieved when the screaming subsided. Finally, when they broke in and turned on the lights, they were horrified at what they found. The girl was sitting in the corner of the room with a glazed expression on her face eating the human foot. The practical joke had backfired and they had driven her mad.
 
 [Collected on the Internet, 1999] A medical student had secretly kept a arm of a corpse. He had taken it and put it secretly in his girlfriend's room. He and his roommate waited anxiously in another girl's room for the scream of horror from the soon returning girl. A half hour passed and nothing happened. So the two roomies went into the girlfriends room . . . There they found her on top of the cupboard actually eating the arm!
 Variations:
    The \"cadaver arm\" stands apart from all other body-parts-used-in-a-prank stories because of the victim's reaction (madness) and the expression of that reaction (she eats the arm). In the other tales of this genre, victims might faint, scream or even have heart attacks when they discover themselves in the presence of unattached body parts, but in none of them do they go mad. That fate is always reserved for the girl who finds an arm in her bed. There are numerous \"cadaver parts and medical students\" legends in existence, with the typical plot of them being a corpse or its parts are shanghaied by a medical student (possibly with the help of his buddies) and used to scare the bejeezus out of people. Undoubtedly, some of these stories are true and the events as described did indeed happen at least a couple of times. However, it should be pointed out that most of these stories have long since passed into the realm of lore, with each new class of medical students being told this prank or that was played out right in this very medical school just last term. Some of the more common of these tales are:        There are reasons for these tales — they play an important role in the metamorphosis of medical students into doctors. The activities as described in cadaver stories represent a way for the student to prove he's triumphed over the cadaver, the confrontation and dissection of which we can imagine must have caused him no small grief. These legends also define medical students as a group apart from the rest in that they've had to handle dead bodies and parts thereof, and this has helped to foster in them the necessary emotional detachment for when they advance to doing the same things to living people. The boundaries between medical students and non-medical students are thus drawn, with the medical students choosing to self-define as emotionally tough and perhaps even a bit callous in the face of the demise of others. They exult in their detachment, celebrating it as proof they were meant to be doctors. There's also an element of \"whistling through the graveyard\" in that fellow medical students are expected to laugh at these stories as a way of showing they are not now afraid of going hands on with mortality even if they're still quaking in their boots inwardly at the thought of touching the dead. The ability to find humor in the macabre is a way of (superficially at least) proving oneself tough enough to last in the medical profession. Failure to laugh at these stories is to risk being seen as a wimp by the rest of the group. Note that the same story told to outsiders is expected to prompt reactions of shock and disgust, further defining the difference between being a member of \"us\" and being one of \"them.\" Barbara \"feint of heart\" Mikkelson Sightings: This legend appears in the 1972 M.E.

"Barbara Mikkelson" 1999-04-29 "A lone driver spots a \"body\" lying on the road but takes a detour around it instead of stopping to investigate. She later discovers she made the right choice — she'd driven over the four men lying in wait for her." "Claim: A lone driver spots a \"body\" lying on the road but takes a detour around it instead of stopping to investigate. She later discovers she made the right choice — she'd driven over the four men lying in wait for her.  Examples:  A young lady on her way home in her 4 by 4 from an evening out approaches a set of traffic lights in a deserted area and sees the body of a man lying in the middle of the junction. Realising that hi-jackers often use this ruse to lure their unsuspecting victims out of their cars the young lady drives off the road and into the adjoining veld (overgrown wasteland) and skirts around the junction and the prostrate form. She drives to the local police station to report the incident (just in case the lifeless form is genuine). The police escort her back to the scene where there is no sign of the man who was lying in the road. However, after a little further investigation the police discover the dead bodies of 3 (or 4) armed men in the veld where they had been lying in wait for her to stop the vehicle. She had ridden over them when she took her detour around the \"body\".
 
 [Collected on the Internet, 1999] A woman was driving home one night (in her 4 wheel drive vehicle) along a remote road outside Johannesburg, an area where numerous car-jackings had taken place. Ahead of her she saw an abandoned car parked across the middle of the narrow road. Fully aware of the danger of stopping, or even slowing down, she pushed her foot down on the accelerator, and drove off the road, along the bumpy grass shoulder, and back onto the road when she had passed the car. When she got home she phoned the police, reported the suspicious vehicle and went to bed. In the morning, she was paid a visit by the police. They asked for more information about the previous night's events. She could only repeat that she had driven at high speed, and fortunately, as she was in a 4 wheel drive was able to drive off the road, through the brush, and back onto the road. It then transpired that in doing so she had driven over and killed the three men who were lying in wait to ambush her.
 Origins: Though not heard too often in North America, the preceding legend has been rife in South Africa at least since 1996. (I'm told five out of every ten South Africans claims this story happened to a friend or neighbor.) Any carjacking legend that has the intended victim not only foiling the attempt but also doing in a couple of the bad guys is going to find a very receptive audience in South Africa. Within the last decade, violent crime has become a fact of life in that country, with vicious carjackings suddenly almost an everyday occurrence even in the best neighborhoods. Many South Africans — black and white — will not now venture out of their homes without a gun. For good reason too: In 1997 the boys with the calculators worked out that every week in South Africa there were 434 murders, 7,210 thefts, 1,218 armed robberies and 952 rapes. That's nothing to sneeze at, considering there are only 40.5 million people in the whole country. To put these numbers in better perspective, South Africa's 1997 murder rate was 52 people per 100,000, compared with a U.S. rate of 6.8 the same year. Armed carjacking occurs on an all too frequent basis, taking place mainly in relatively populated areas: at traffic lights and stop signs, in parking lots, and in the driveways of homes. In the first eleven months of 1998, there were 13,000 carjackings. Fewer than one in ten carjacking cases ends up in court, and only one in fifty ends in a conviction. Moreover, people end up dead over this. Being carjacked has become a major fear of every South African vehicle owner. In 1994, 17,560 vehicles were hijacked (another 91,786 were simply stolen). In the process, 36 people were killed and another 851 injured. South Africans are fighting back. As the problems worsened and more temperate responses failed to have appreciable effect (educating drivers about how to spot trouble and avoid confrontations, installing conventional anti-theft devices on vehicles), more drastic measures have taken their place. In 1999, it's possible to get your car equipped with the latest in personal security weapons — a driver-operated flamethrower called The Blaster. The $650 device is built into the car doors, and is operated by pushing a button beside the foot pedals. It sends a man-high fireball from the car, engulfing the hijacker without endangering passengers or damaging the car's paint job. That might sound like overkill, but consider this: conventional solutions have failed badly, often only working to escalate the danger to drivers. South Africa used to be a nation plagued by run-of-the-mill auto thefts in which cars were made off with while their owners were elsewhere. As auto theft statistics began to soar, owners invested in more and more sophisticated security devices. The most popular of these was the high-tech \"immobilizer\" which ensures the starter motor will accept only the original key. Being crafty, the thieves, upon realizing that they too needed the original keys to start cars, shifted from theft to carjacking. Ignition switches in many of the more expensive cars sold in South Africa were then fitted with combination locks. To start the car, the correct combination had to be punched into the device. This was no problem to the carjackers; it just gave them more cause to be violent. They forced the code information from the carjacked drivers at gun or knife-point. The security people got smarter. They patented a device which could neutralize the engine by remote control from a distance of several kilometers. The idea was that a driver could allow the thief to drive off with the vehicle and then \"immobilize\" it from a safe distance. So the villains took drivers and passengers as hostages, and this inevitably resulted in killings. At this point, owning a car that shoots a fireball starts to sound like a reasonable idea. In South Africa, what in other countries would be a loss-of-property situation becomes a life-and-death struggle. Over the years, the advice given to South African drivers hasn't been much more effective at preventing carjackings than the non-aggressive security devices mentioned above. A 1995 article suggested ramming the car in front of you at an intersection if someone attempted to carjack your vehicle. (No, I've no idea what good that would do either.) A 1997 article gave the following advice for avoiding becoming a carjack statistic in South Africa. In short: Don't drive, and don't own a car. And if you must do either, then be prepared to never relax your vigilance.   
  
  
  
  
  
 Now that you're a little better acquainted with the carjacking situation in South Africa, you probably better understand the delight often expressed over this legend. Ordinary citizens are ending up hurt, maimed, or dead simply because they own cars someone else wants to sell for parts. That one of those ordinary citizens could not only escape unharmed but in the process kill off three or four of these murderers is seen as nothing but justice come at last.

"Barbara Mikkelson" 1999-04-29 "Chinese restaurants in the U.S. use cat meat in their entrees." "Original title:\"Mew Goo Guy Ding\"How old is old? The rumor about Fluffy's or Fido's being slipped into Chinese food by unscrupulous restaurateurs has been traced by British researchers to the earliest years of the British Empire in England and to the 1850s in the United States: [Jacobsen, 1948] How ripe small towns actually are for rumors was amply demonstrated a few years ago. In a town of thirteen thousand inhabitants, which was gradually blossoming into cityhood, there was a restaurant operated by three Chinese. It was the most successful eating place around, patronized by businessmen and citizens morning, noon, and night. Everyone agreed that the food and service were good. But without the slightest warning business suddenly took a drastic drop. The once-prosperous proprietors became miserably unhappy, for they could not understand what had happened to all their patrons. Then they found out that someone, maybe a competitor, maybe just a person who nursed a real or imagined grudge against Chinese, had initiated a rumor that the police had found three skinned cats, labeled rabbits, in the restaurant's refrigerator. Ancient slur or not, wherever this rumor goes it affects how the locals feel about the Chinese in their midst, and it often impacts a restaurant's fragile bottom line: [Smith, 1983] One evening several friends went out to a local Chinese restaurant for a celebratory meal. Half way through the meal one of the party suddenly started to cough and choke. Thoroughly alarmed they rushed her to hospital and she had to undergo minor surgery to remove a small bone stuck in her throat. The surgeon who removed the bone was somewhat perplexed as he did not recognise the type of bone found. He therefore sent it off for analysis and the report came back saying that it was a rat bone. The public health department immediately visited the restaurant to inspect the kitchens and in the fridge they found numerous tins of cat food, half an Alsatian dog and several rats all waiting to be served up.
 [Collected on the Internet, 1999] Okay, at this chinese restaurant where I live, it's called moon palace, they suddenly closed down. Everybody wondered why they closed down, but then we finally heard the truth. When the health inspectors went to inspect the so-called \"clean\" facility, they found cages and cages of cats. So they were like \"okay\" and then they went to the freezer. FROZEN CATS EVERYWHERE!!!! Happy eating! As an example (this rumor has turned up in so many cities, it would be impossible to list them all), in 1995 the closing of two Chinese restaurants in Columbus, Ohio, awakened the sleeping rumor yet again. Calls were fielded, both by the local paper and the board of health, about whispers that these closings were the result of dead cats' being discovered in each eatery's meat locker. Never mind that just the previous day the local paper had run a story about the closure (for business reasons) of all 51 restaurants in this particular chain — the cat meat rumor would not be denied.  In 1996, county health department officials in Knoxville, Tennessee, stepped forward to issue a strong denial about frozen cats' being found at a particular local Chinese restaurant. It seemed everyone had heard the rumor, yet no such complaint was on file. Indeed, this particular restaurant had always met Health Department regulations, a claim supported by inspection records. In 1991, after a Burlington, Ontario [Canada] Chinese eatery lost 30% of its trade to this rumor, its owners attempted to combat the talk by inviting the local professional football team, the Hamilton Ti-Cats, to eat there on the house. Due to the loss of business, restaurant staff had seen their work week cut by 10 hours. The trouble had started two months earlier, with its first sign being a phone call from a woman asking if the restaurant was closed. A friend had told her health officials had padlocked the 434-seat restaurant because it \"had been serving cat.\" That call was the first of many to the restaurant, the health department, and the media. Callers often said others told them the rumor was on radio or in the papers, but no such reports had been broadcast or published. Again, this restaurant had a good reputation with the health department, but that didn't stop the progress of the rumor and the damage it did to the livelihoods of the small business owners and their employees. This legend is a classic example of xenophobia (fear and hatred of foreigners or that which is foreign). Asian culture is markedly different from Western culture, with language but the first barrier to be hurdled. Customs, religious observances, traditions — all are wildly different from their North American counterparts. As with all xenophobic reactions, that which isn't the same is vilified. The Asian culinary practice of making a tiny bit of meat stretch to feed a family by cutting it up fine and making it part of a larger dish of vegetables or noodles is transformed by fear into a vehicle for \"them\" to slip something objectionable into our unwitting stomachs. Likewise, that the Chinese don't as a rule keep cats and dogs as pets becomes seen as a willingness to plop someone else's animal companion into the stew pot. Anything for a buck, says this legend, and if in the process one puts over on the white devils, so much the better. Though the Chinese have been known to dine on cats or dogs in their homeland, the practice is predominant primarily in far-flung regions, and they don't serve them up on unsuspecting diners in Europe or North America, where these animals are known to enjoy the exalted status of family pets. It is true that dog is more or less routinely consumed in Korea, where it's seen as a game meat, but even there Western sensibilities are catered to on this issue. When the Olympics were held in Seoul in 1988, every wire service ran stories about dog being one of the dishes that could be ordered in a restaurant there. In response, the South Korean government temporarily shut down more than 400 eateries where dog soup was a staple. It knew visiting cultures would never understand. (Likewise, in 2008 China ordered that none of the 112 officially designated Olympic restaurants in Beijing sell dog meat dishes during the games.) In North America, few, if any, Chinese or Koreans eat dog. (See our Hound by the Pound page for the story of an elaborate hoax about a Korean-American company approaching animal shelters with an offer to buy excess dogs.) Also in North America, the Vietnamese are tarred with a variation of the Chinese restaurant rumor: according to this version, when a Vietnamese family moves into the neighborhood, all the stray cats disappear. That few, if any, Vietnamese in the U.S. eat cat doesn't impact this rumor one whit.

"David Mikkelson" 1999-04-06 "Gang members all over the country are spreading a deadly mixture of LSD and strychnine on pay phone buttons." "Claim: Gang members all over the country are spreading a deadly mixture of LSD and strychnine on pay phone buttons. FALSE Example: [Collected on the Internet, 1999]  Hello, my name is Tina Strongman and I work at a police station, as a phone operator for 911. Lately, we've received many phone calls pertaining to a new sort of problem that has arisen in the inner cities, and is now working it's way to smaller towns. It seems that a new form of gang initiation is to go find as many pay phones as possible and put a mixture of LSD and Strychnine onto the buttons. This mixture is deadly to the human touch, and apparently, this has killed some people on the east coast. Strychnine is a chemical used in rat poison and is easily separated from the rest of the chemicals. When mixed with LSD, it creates a substance that is easily absorbed into the human flesh, and highly fatal. Please be careful if you are using a pay phone anywhere. You may want to wipe it off, or just not use one at all. Please be very careful.
Let your friends and family know about this potential hazard.
Thank you.
 Origins: Apparently the recent two-pronged  attack on American society being waged by gang members and drug addicts hasn't fared as well as they'd hoped, so now they've joined forces in yet another scheme: spreading a deadly mixture of strychnine and LSD on pay phone buttons. (A mixture, we're told, which is \"highly fatal.\" These gangs are killers — they aren't going to mess around with any of that \"slightly fatal\" stuff.) (With both pay phone coin slots and pay phone buttons now reportedly being primed to deliver a lethal payload to unsuspecting users, we're beginning to wonder if maybe the cellular phone industry isn't behind all this scarelore. If the next rumor that comes down the pipe has to do with something deadly on payphone handsets, we may have something here.) We all know the drill: a \"important\" warning message from a source who is named but might as well be anonymous, since she provides no details or contact information (not even the name of a city). Said person claims to know that this problem has \"arisen in the inner cities, and is now working it's [sic] way to smaller towns\" even though this is the first anyone else has heard of it, and tells us that this nefarious trap \"has killed some people on the east coast\" although no reports of any such deaths have made the news. And as a \"gang initiation ritual,\" this one is pretty lame. Gang initiations are supposed to provide prospective members with the opportunity to prove their worthiness by demonstrating their courage and bravery. There's nothing courageous or brave about spreading poison on payphones and waiting for hapless victims to push a few buttons and drop dead. As a gang rite, it ranks right up there with \"ding-dong ditch.\" (The effectiveness of this scheme is dubious as well — if the victim didn't come along immediately after the application of the deadly mixture, he'd probably have to have sweaty hands or hold his finger to a button for several minutes, since momentary contact with the dried product would likely have no effect. This would also be one heck of an expensive prank.) You have to give credit to whoever cooked this one up, though — he knew all the right details to include to ensure his bit of creative writing spread far and wide: gang members, drugs, poison, dead innocent victims, and an \"official police source\" to warn us of it all. And you have to admire a message that has the chutzpah to tell you to forward it to everyone you know, even if you don't read it first. This is a work of art in the urban legends field comparable to the creation of Melissa in the PC viruses field. The mention of strychnine and LSD was a deft touch. Strychnine and LSD have long been associated with each other, through beliefs that strychnine is a by-product or contaminant resulting from the production of LSD, that some drug users add strychnine to their LSD because it produces a better experience, that drug sellers use strychnine to make LSD bond to blotter paper more efficiently, or that unscrupulous drug dealers cut costs by mixing strychnine with the LSD they sell. (The latter item, like the claim about McDonald's adding worm meat to their hamburgers, is implausible because it posits that an unscrupulous vendor is trying to save money by padding his product with a \"filler\" more expensive than the product itself.) Treat this one like you would a fabulous forgery: Admire it as a work of art, but don't try to pass it off as the real thing. Last updated: 12 July 2011

"David Mikkelson" 1999-03-29 "A babysitter left alone in charge of sleeping children receives several mysterious, threatening phone calls." "This tale, like several other adolescent horror legends, seemingly originated (or at least was first collected) in the early 1960s: Example: [Smith, 1983] A young couple living in a large isolated house had gone out to a dinner party one evening and left the baby-sitter in charge of their two children. The children had been put to bed and the baby-sitter was watching the television when the phone rang. She answered but all she heard was a man laughing hysterically and then a voice saying, \"I'm upstairs with the children, you'd better come up.\" Thinking it was \"one of those phone calls\" or a practical joke she slammed down the receiver and turned the television sound up. A short time later the phone rang again and, as she picked it up, the unmistakable hysterical laughter came down the line and the voice once again said \"I'm upstairs with the children, you'd better come up.\" Getting rather frightened she called the operator and was advised they would notify the police and, should he phone again, could she keep him talking in order to give them time to trace the call and have him arrested. Minutes after she replaced the receiver the phone rang again and, when the voice said, \"I'm upstairs with the children, you'd better come up,\" she tried to keep him talking. However, he must have guessed what she was trying to do and he put the phone down. Only seconds later the phone rang again, this time it was the operator who said, \"Get out of the house straight away, the man is on the extension.\" The baby-sitter put down the phone and just then heard someone coming down the stairs. She fled from the house and ran straight into the arms of the police. They burst into the house and found a man brandishing a large butcher's knife. He had entered the house through an upstairs window, murdered both the children and was just about to do the same to the poor baby-sitter. Variations: Its obvious features deal with the insecurity felt by adolescents as they are required to accept increasing responsibilities while making the<IMG SRC=\"https://www.snopes.com/uploads/images/horrors/graphics/babysit.jpg\" WIDTH=209 HEIGHT=194 VSPACE=16 HSPACE=16 ALT=\"Urban legend cartoon\" ALIGN=RIGHT style=\"border:1px solid black\"> transition to adulthood. The teenage girl is not simply left alone to fend for herself, but she is also made responsible for the safety of other children (in what might be considered a \"dress rehearsal\" for motherhood). She fails at her task in the most catastrophic manner (with the implication that she is at least partly to blame for being too absorbed in watching television), and, in a delicious irony, she herself is threatened through the instrument that is a teenage girl's favorite means of social communication. Sightings: The plot of the 1979 movie When A Stranger Calls is based on this legend. The 1974 film Black Christmas features a murdering maniac hiding in a sorority's attic who telephones after every killing. In the 1998 film Urban Legend, the folklore professor regales his class with this legend.<FONT COLOR=\"\" class=\"copyright_text_color_g\"><B>Last updated:</B></FONT> &nbsp; 20 May 2014 29 March 1999 - original 28 April 2002 - added Fiery 6 October 2006 - reformatted" 1999 "Mar" 3 1970

"David Mikkelson" 1999-03-24 "A pet owner ships the body of a beloved animal by air; unknowing baggage handlers fear they've killed the animal and replace it with a live one." "Claim: A pet owner ships the body of a beloved animal by air; unknowing baggage handlers fear they've killed the animal and replace it with a live one. LEGEND Example: [Eilbirt, 1991]  At Lod airport she disembarks, and through some strange circumstance, the dog, cage and all, had disappeared. She keeps needling the airline people, telling them that they should have listened to her and permitted her to keep the dog with her on the plane. Needless to say, the airport personnel are very apologetic, but keep reassuring her that the animal will be found and returned to her. Sure enough, the cage turns up, but to their consternation they discover that the dog is dead! Swiftly, they contact every kennel in Israel and, luckily, they find a dog that looks almost identical to the dead one. This whole process has taken several hours, during which they have received numerous phone calls and complaints from the lady. Now the airport manager calls her up and tells her, \"Madam, we will have your dog at your hotel within an hour.\" And he is as good as his word. Forty-two minutes later he himself arrives at the Hilton with the cage and dog. The lady takes one look at the dog and starts to wail: \"That's not my dog! That's not my dog! You liars, thieves. What have you done with my pet?\" Well, the manager sees that he is in the soup; he might as well confess. \"Madame,\" he reports, \"unfortunately when we found your dog, it was dead. So we disposed of it and got you a replacement which is almost an exact replica of the one that died.\" But the woman won't be soothed. \"You fools, liars, no-goods. That dog was dead when I put it on the plane! Don't you understand anything? I wanted to bring it to the Holy Land to bury in sacred soil!\"  Origins: This tale is nearly identical in structure to the Hare Dryer legend: Both feature persons who, mistakenly believing themselves to be responsible for the death of someone else's pet, try to cover up their culpability by replacing the dead animals — only to find that they have exacerbated an unfortunate situation by substituting a live (or seemingly live) pet in place of one that was already dead. As anyone who has watched television knows, the substitution of a similar-looking animal for a pet that dies while in the hands of  a caretaker is a stock comedic plot. (The owner is rarely fooled by the ruse, of course.) This particular version (with its twist of an
already dead animal \"dying\" again) had been around (according to Brunvand) for \"at least a dozen years\" by 1988. It enjoyed an upswelling of popularity that year, perhaps due in part to its inclusion in lectures delivered by Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North (of Iran-Contra notoriety). More recently, during an appearance on Late Night with David Letterman, actor Steven Seagal told this story as having happened to him. Sightings: It's impossible to keep a good legend down, as Click and Clack, the hosts of radio's Car Talk, discovered on 9 March 1996 when a caller named Max not only claimed this happened to him but added a level of hilarity to the existing legend by rounding out his version with a twist of being forced to keep the replacement dog and being billed $75 a week to feed it.

"Barbara Mikkelson" 1999-03-21 "A helpful male stranger begging a ride at a shopping mall turns out to be a crazed killer." "Claim: A helpful male stranger begging a ride at a shopping mall turns out to be a crazed killer. LEGEND Examples:  This lady had finished her shopping, and she went back to her car with her packages. When she got to the car, there was someone sitting in the back seat. As she approached, she saw it was an old woman. She asked the woman what she was doing in her car, and the woman said that she had gotten lost looking for the bus and got so tired that she just had to sit somewhere to rest, and asked if she could possibly see her way to driving her home or just to the nearest bus stop. Well, this lady was suspicious, so she said that she would be right back, and she returned to the mall and asked security if they could do something about the old woman. When a security guard got to the car, they found out she wasn't an old woman at all, but a man; and in her purse was a small hatchet.
 
 [Collected on the Internet, 1998] A woman was shopping at the Tuttle Mall in Columbus. She came out to her car and saw she had a flat. She got her jack, spare out of the trunk. A man in a business suit came up and started to help her. When the tire had been replaced, he asked for a ride to his car on the opposite side of the Mall. Feeling uncomfortable about doing this, she stalled for awhile, but he kept pressing her. She finally asked why he was on this side of the Mall if his car was on the other. He claimed he had been talking to friends. Still uncomfortable, she told him that she had just remembered something she had forgotten to pick up at the mall and she left him and went back inside the mall. She reported the incident to the mall security and they went out to her car. The man was nowhere in sight. Opening her trunk, she discovered a brief case the man had set inside her trunk while helping her with the tire. Inside was rope and a butcher knife! When she took the tire to be fixed, the mechanic informed her that there was nothing wrong with her tire, that it was flat because the air had been let out of it!
 
 [Smith, 1983] Driving home alone one evening, a young woman notices an old lady with a large shopping bag trying to hitch a lift in her direction. Feeling charitable, and in spite of her vow never to pick up hitch-hikers when alone, the girl stops and offers the hitch-hiker a ride. With much gratitude the old lady accepts and gets into the car. The young woman is about to drive away when she notices that her \"female\" passenger has large hairy arms and wrists. Guessing instantly that the old lady is in fact a man, she pretends to be having trouble with the car and asks him to get out and check if the rear lights are working. As soon as the \"old lady\" is round the back of the car, the young woman immediately locks the doors and drives away. In fear she goes straight to the police station where she is questioned and the car is searched. In the shopping bag the hairy-handed hitch-hiker has left behind, the police find a large and very sharp blood-stained axe — all all ready for the next victim.
 
 [Collected on the Internet, 2001] Please read this, a new twist on kidnapping, a very smart survivor. About a month ago there was a woman standing by the mega mall entrance passing out flyers to all the women going in. The woman had written the flyer herself to tell about an experience she had, so that she might warn other women. The previous day, this woman had finished shopping, went out to her car and discovered that she had a flat. She got the jack out of the trunk and began to change the flat. A nice man dressed in business suit and carrying a briefcase walked up to her and said, \"I noticed you're changing a flat tire. Would you like me to take care of it for you?\" The woman was grateful for his offer and accepted his help. They chatted amiably while the man changed the flat, and then put the flat tire and the jack in the trunk, shut it and dusted his hands off. The woman thanked him profusely, and as she was about to get in her car, the man told her that he left his car around on the other side of the mall, and asked if she would mind giving him a lift to his car. She was a little surprised and she asked him why his car was on other side. He explained that he had seen an old friend in the mall that he hadn't seen for some time and they had a bite to eat and visited for a while; he got turned around in the mall and left through the wrong exit, and now he was running late and his car was clear around on the other side of the mall. The woman hated to tell him \"no\" because he had just rescued her from having to change her flat tire all by herself, but she felt uneasy. Then she remembered seeing the man put his briefcase in her trunk before shutting it and before he asked her for a ride to his car. She told him that she'd be happy to drive him around to his car, but she just remembered one last thing she needed to buy. She said she would only be a few minutes; he could sit down in her car and wait for her; she would be as quick as she could be. She hurried into the mall, and told a security guard what had happened; the guard came out to her car with her, but the man had left. They opened the trunk, took out his locked briefcase and took it down to the police station. The police opened it (ostensibly to look for ID so they could return it to the man). What they found was rope, duct tape, and knives. When the police checked her \"flat\" tire, there was nothing wrong with it; the air had simply been let out. It was obvious what the man's intention was, and obvious that he had carefully thought it out in advance. The woman was blessed to have escaped harm. How much worse it would have been if she had children with her and had them wait in the car while the man fixed the tire, or if she had a baby strapped into a car seat. Or if she'd gone against her judgment and given him a lift. I'd like you to forward this to all the women you know. It may save a life. A candle is not dimmed by lighting another candle.

 [Collected on the Internet, 2006] Last week in the Asda car park at Owlcotes, a lady returned to her car to find the window broken. A helpful man at the side of the car said he had seen someone tampering with it and had remained with the vehicle to make sure no-one did any further damage. The lady was very grateful and when the man asked for a lift she was quite disappointed she was in a rush and going in the wrong direction and could not return the favour. It was only when she got home that she noticed in the pouch behind her seat a piece of rope and a knife.
 
 [Collected on the Internet, 2004] The Dublin criminal gang - The Westies are having an initiation ceremony at the moment for new members. It's aimed at women driving alone. They hang around garages and when a woman alone goes into the garage to pay for her petrol, a guy gets into the car and hides in the back seat. When the woman gets into her car the guy holds her at knifepoint and takes her to be gang-raped. This is a serious message that came to me by my Father. He was talking to his friend who is a Detective in Garda H.Q in Harcourt Street. The Detective told Dad to pass this on to women. One incident has happened in Dublin but luckily the woman got away. The petrol attendant saw a guy getting into her car and hiding in the back seat. He called her back pretending there was a problem with her credit card. They called the police and they took the guy to Blanch station to be questioned. Please, please pass this on and be careful. LOCK YOUR CAR when you are paying for petrol and just be careful.
 
 [Collected on the Internet, May 2010] A colleague of mine at work (Belinda) has just gathered us girls and told us that her gf that works at the Galleria shopping Centre in Morley had a bit of a situation just over a week ago and all females in Perth should know about it! Her friend came out of work after 5:30pm and walked up to her car to find an old lady standing next to it and her car had a smashed window. The old woman said that she had seen the smashed window and she had stood by the car for 20 mins as she didn't want anyone to come along and steal something out of it. The girl was really grateful and the old lady explained she had missed her bus in the process and asked if she could get a lift. The young girl agreed and within a few minutes she noticed that the nanna had really manly hands, so she panicked and didn't know what to do so she ran into the back of the car in front of her at a really slow speed but enough to make the other ppl get out of the car, the police were called and the old lady ran and soon after the cops found a rope and a knife under the passenger seat. This happened in May 2010 on the streets of Perth. TELL ALL OF YOUR FRIENDS!!!
 Variations:        Origins: Fear not that this is going on at a shopping mall near you, or that the country is awash in gangs of rapists and serial killers using such ruses to lure unsuspecting women into dangerous situations. We've found only one actual case that mimics any of the forms this urban legend has taken over the years, and it happened in 1989. On 16 December 1989, 29-year-old Sedrick Cobb kidnapped 23-year-old Julie Ashe from a department store parking lot in Waterbury, CT, after he helped her change a flat tire on her car that he had let the air out of while she was in the store Christmas shopping. He then drove Miss Ashe to a wooded area, raped her, bound her, and pushed her off a dam into an icy pond 23 feet below. Her feet were found protruding from the ice on Christmas Day, nine days after she disappeared. There's no evidence similar incidents have happened anywhere else. (Especially not at the Tuttle Mall in Columbus, Ohio — that institution has been deviled by this rumor ever since the item quoted above in the \"Examples\" section as the second offering hit the Internet. \"It's an Internet rumor,\" said David Casper, the mall's marketing director. \"We checked all of the reports our security had. We checked the videotapes on the day it was supposed to have happened. Then we checked the police reports in all the districts.\") Though told as a recent crime, this legend's roots reach back into the previous century. The driver is a gentleman in his gig, who on opening the supposed female's reticule finds to his horror a brace of loaded pistols inside. The above snippet comes from the 11 April 1834 Stamford Mercury. 1834. As in, before the American Civil War. The legend shows up again in the 1956 book Negro Folktales in  Michigan, where a young buggy driver spots five o'clock shadow under a lady passenger's bonnet. The lad contrives to lose his hat and asks the woman to recover it while he controls the skittish horses. Once she's out of the rig, he drives off. Later, \"he picks up the basket and looks in it, to give to his wife, and there's two Colt .44's in there, and eight hundred dollars in cash money.\" In the late 1970s, the \"hairy armed hitchhiker\" myth was all the rage in the UK; everyone was telling it as a close call that had befallen a friend of a friend. Why that sudden outbreak of an old legend in that particular place and time? That was the era of the Yorkshire Ripper. People feared for their lives, and part of that fear was expressed through the telling of (and believing!) of this legend. During that period, reports of this tale were received in at least 17 police stations. (No telling how often each station heard it either!) These days the \"shopping mall\" version has come to eclipse the earlier \"hitchhiker\" form of the story. This is likely the result of two changes in our culture: the growing fear of hitchhikers, and the ascendancy of the shopping mall as a place to congregate. Though frowned upon, hitchhiking in the 1960s and up to the mid-1970s was seen as a normal, almost reasonable activity (albeit a bit on the risque or defiant of society's customs side). Ordinary folks stopped to pick up hitchhikers, barely giving their personal safety a second thought, and those hitching a ride happily took the same chance with about as much forethought. It was then common for teens and twenty-somethings to use the thumb to get from here to there and for even older people to explore the country by way of this mode of transportation. These days you don't see many hitchhikers. There's too much fear of the murdering stranger, both on the part of those who would otherwise offer a ride and those would stick out a thumb to seek one. With the decline in popularity of hitchhiking came a decline in the popularity of the hitchhiker version of this dead catter. Urban legends are expressions of current culture; if hitchhiking is no longer a popular activity, expect to see that element dropped from the legend as the tale is re-cast to place it in a current culture setting. The growing importance of the shopping mall to our culture also played its part. What started out as mere collections of varied stores under one roof quickly came to evolve into social gathering places. The mall is somewhere to await friends or, once met, to pass the time with them. Though their mercantile function is still important, the mall's social and societal role is growing all the time. As for shopping centers and their place in this legend, folklorist Jan Harold Brunvand had this to say: The mall is our society's center of consumer passion, of all items both wonderful and mundane, and yet something inside us seems to be saying that even the mall is not safe from the evil forces of the world. True enough. Brightly lit and well patrolled, malls are seen as safe havens. Their darkened parking lots exist in a netherworld, close enough to the mall for help to be summoned from, but far enough away to be outside of the mall's protection. Coming at it from a less folkloric, more pragmatic angle, a mall parking lot would be the obvious place for a mythical crazed killer looking for victims, hence the legend's shift in locale. Found there would be many women, a goodly number of them alone, each of them isolated once they leave the safety of the building to head for their cars. A murdering madman looking to pick and choose his victims could find no better venue. It would be like handing him a menu. Though it's never clearly stated, it is understood by all who hear the legend the bad guy's intent is to murder the woman, not merely rob her. His weapon is invariably a sharp object, something that will serve to splash copious amounts of blood everywhere (as opposed to a polite strangling or restrained bludgeoning) because the mental picture of what could have happened is key to this tale's horror element. Dead isn't good enough; the averted murder has to be perceived as unspeakably brutal and gory. In common with all \"murdering madmen\" legends, almost without exception the prey is female and the stalker male. This probably has less to do with out and out sexism than it does with employing a folkloric shorthand to communicate the victim's vulnerability in contrast to the killer's omnipotence. Why the shorthand, the exaggeration of the imbalance? Upon hearing any of these legends, we mentally cast ourselves in the role of the person it happened to. By making the mythical victim appear both especially at risk and not all that capable of protecting herself, we more clearly express our own fears of the world around us and our personal sense of being vulnerable to attack.

"David Mikkelson" 1999-03-15 "Young girls are tripped by a stranger and sent plummeting to their deaths from theater balconies." "Claim: Young girls are tripped by a stranger and sent plummeting to their deaths from theater balconies. Status: False. Example: [Collected on the Internet, 1999]  A two girls go to a movie theater. They decide it would help them to see better if they went up to the balcony. Once there, they decide to sit on the front row of the balcony. A man is already sitting on the front row, two seats from the aisle appearing to be sleeping. The girls don't want to step over the man so they occupy the two end seats. When the movie starts with the sudden sound check the man \"awakens\" startledly and spills soda on one of the girls. When she, with authority, gets up to wipe herself off, the man trips her and she falls over the balcony to her death. On the other two times that this has happened, the victim was paralized from the neck down. PLEASE BE AWARE OF YOUR SURROUNDINGS WHEN VENTURING OFF TO THE MOVIE THEATER!!!
 Origins: Such are the times that it's actually refreshing to see a new horror legend that doesn't involve needles, AIDS, drugs, gangs or abducted women — just an old-fashioned random serial killer who doesn't need a murder weapon other than his own two feet. What this legend does share with most others of its ilk is the setting. Describing the random, senseless deaths of victims who are killed while at the site of a pleasurable activity (fishing hole, amusement park, movie theater, dance club, golf club) is a staple of horror legends. In this case the death is neither an unintentional one caused by an accident or a non-human agent (such as the recent legend about snakes in ball pits) or one with a deliberate purpose beyond mere senseless killing (such as a the gang initation ritual found in the resurgent legend about headlight flashing). Here we have a stranger who kills or maims young women in movie theaters for no apparent reason other than the thrill of it all. We know this urban legend-like message must be serious, because it has the hallmarks of the usual Important Internet Warning of a Dire and Imminent Threat to You and Your Loved Ones: a initial statement assuring us that the information presented is true, a description of some horrible crime being perpetrated against innocent victims, and a cautionary closing paragraph typed IN CAPITAL LETTERS and ending with MULTIPLE EXCLAMATION POINTS!!! What's not included, of course, are the usual verifiable details: dates, names of cities, names of victims, names of police contacts, etc. Since the message claims three different occurrences of girls' being attacked in movie theaters by someone with the same modus operandi (but no mention of this being a gang initiation rite), we can probably assume the crimes are the work of a single man. If so, why he is still on the loose? At the very least, why don't we have a description of him? In all three cases only one of a pair of girls was killed or injured; the other surely saw the monster pull off his crime and described it to someone, or else we wouldn't know the details: that the murderer pretended to be asleep, sat two seats from the aisle, \"woke up\" when the sound check played, \"accidentally\" spilled his drink, and finally deliberately tripped one of the girls to send her hurtling off the balcony. The criminal couldn't have escaped too quickly for anyone to see him, as he would have had to climb over or around at least some theater seats (and possibly other patrons) to effect his escape. The theater lights may have been turned down for the beginning of the program, but movie theaters aren't so dark that you couldn't at least observe the height, clothing, and general features of another person standing right in front of you (and it apparently wasn't too dark to notice that the man deliberately tripped his victims). So why do we not have the smallest bit of descriptive information about this heinous madman? Scarelore warnings like this one, even if they do describe apocryphal events, usually at least offer some valid warnings: keep your eyes on your children at all times, be careful of giving rides to strangers, don't make safety judgments based solely on a person's appearance, etc. But \"be careful in movie theater balconies lest someone push you over the edge\"? If this is a lesson we need reinforced, we're in bigger trouble than I thought. Last updated: 6 October 2006

"Barbara Mikkelson" 1998-12-31 "Scientists drilling in Siberia went too far and ended up punching a hole through to Hell, where the screams of the damned drifted up to them." "The legend of the \"well to Hell\" is one that particularly appeals to some Christian groups as offering confirmation that Hell (and therefore God) exists: Geologists working somewhere in remote Siberia had drilled a hole some 14.4 kilometers deep (about 9 miles) when the drill bit suddenly began to rotate wildly. A Mr. Azzacov (identified as the project's manager) was quoted as saying they decided that the center of the earth was hollow. Supposedly, the geologists measured temperatures of over 2,000 degrees in the deep hole. They lowered super sensitive microphones to the bottom of the well, and to their astonishment they heard the sounds of thousands, perhaps millions, of suffering souls screaming. Popular endings to the story have it that scientists (the symbols of atheism) ran screaming from the site in terror when confronted with such proof, or that since the discovery of Hell conversions to Christianity began occurring at an unprecedented rate.  If there is a Hell under Siberia, scientists have yet to discover it. What we have here is an enthralling legend that's been spun off an actual event. In 1984, an article about an experimental well in Russia's Kola Peninsula appeared in Scientific American. The Kola well reached 12 kilometers into the ground, where scientists encountered rare rock formations, flows of gas and water, and temperatures up to 180°. (That's 180°, folks, not the 2,000° usually reported in any \"Scientists Discover Hell!\" screed. It was hot, but it wasn't hellishly so.) Those who did the actual drilling of this very real well did not break through to a hollow centre, and certainly no piteous screams of the damned were heard. That part of the story was pure embellishment added after this real event was turned into a legend. (Yes, we know that any number of web sites offer audio clips purporting to be the screams of the damned as recorded in the Well to Hell, and all of them sound like they could be the noise from a typical bar on a busy Friday evening.) The report on the digging of that well and the difficulties encountered during the project collided with someone's vision of what should have been found down there. A little exaggerating about depth and temperature, some fabrication about hollow centres and screams, and all of a sudden there was this great story to throw back at those who claim there is no God. Though it's impossible to pinpoint when the news story about a well in Russia transformed into a story about scientists breaking into Hell or who was responsible for that transformation, we do know that in 1989 the Trinity Broadcasting Network (TBN) aired a \"Scientists Discover Hell\" story and placed the event as happening in the Kola Peninsula. A Norwegian schoolteacher visiting California heard that broadcast and took the story back to Norway with him. He then mailed it to a Christian magazine in Finland. In the form of a letter from a reader, it reached a Finnish missionaries newsletter. From there it returned to the United States, reaching both the TBN people and other evangelists who then claimed they had gotten it from a respected Finnish scientific journal. In the spring of 1990, the legend as we now know it appeared in both Praise The Lord (February) and Midnight Cry (April). Debunkings of it showed up in Christianity Today (July) and Biblical Archaeology Review (November). Even so, the Weekly World News tabloid ran the story in 1992, this time setting it in Alaska and claiming thirteen oil rig workers were killed when the Devil came roaring up out of the ground. You can't beat that for embellishment." 1998 "Dec" 12 1980

And it was a deadly one. Forty minutes past noon on 15 January 1919, a giant wave of molasses raced through Boston. The unseasonably warm temperature (46 degrees) was the final stress needed to cause a gigantic, filled-to-capacity tank to burst. 2,320,000 gallons (14,000 tons) of molasses swept through the streets, causing death and destruction. Eyewitness reports tell of a \"30-foot wall of goo\" that smashed buildings and tossed horses, wagons and pool tables about as if they were nothing. Twenty-one people were killed by the brown tidal wave, and 150 more were injured. The chaos and destruction were amplified — and rescue efforts were hampered — by the stickiness of the molasses. Those persons attempting to aid others all too often found themselves mired fast in the goo. The day after the disaster, the New York Times reported: A dull, muffled roar gave but an instant's warning before the top of the tank was blown into the air. The circular wall broke into two great segments of sheet iron which were pulled in opposite directions. Two million gallons of molasses rushed over the streets and converted into a sticky mass the wreckage of several small buildings which had been smashed by the force of the explosion. The greatest mortality apparently occurred in one of the city buildings where a score of municipal employees were eating their lunch. The building was demolished and the wreckage was hurled fifty yards. The other city building, which had an office on the ground floor and a tenement above, was similarly torn from its foundations. One of the sections of the tank wall fell on the firehouse which was nearby. The building was crushed and three firemen were buried in the ruins. In November 2016, new findings about the Great Molasses Flood were presented at the American Physical Society's Division of Fluid Dynamics in Portland: \"Temperatures dipped just below freezing the night following the accident,\" aerospace engineer and fluid dynamicist Nicole Sharp, lead author of the study, told Live Science. \"Based on our data, it's possible the viscosity of the molasses increased by a factor of four or more due to that drop in temperature. That does not sound like such a big difference, but the high viscosity of the molasses was a major factor for rescue work.\" If the tank had collapsed in warmer weather, the molasses would have been more like honey than tar, and would have \"flowed farther, but also thinner,\" reducing the number of people who became fatally stuck, said Shmuel M. Rubinstein, a Harvard University professor whose students investigated the disaster, according to The New York Times. About half of the victims of the flood, he added, \"died basically because they were stuck.\" The original cause of the deadly disaster, which has remained a mystery for the past century, was explored in another study published [in 2015]. Ronald Mayville, a senior structural and metallurgical engineer with Simpson, Gumpertz & Heger in Waltham, Mass., concluded that several design flaws had contributed to the tank's collapse. The walls of the tank, Mr. Mayville argued, were too thin to hold 2.3 million gallons of molasses and made from a low-manganese steel susceptible to fracture – the same type of steel, coincidentally, used on the Titanic. \"The steel conformed to the standards of the time,\" Mayville told the Boston Globe. \"But now it’s known you need to have a higher ratio.\" Boston is not a city that forgets anything easily. There are those who claim that on a hot summer day in the North End, you can still smell the molasses." 1998 "Dec" 12 1910

"David Mikkelson" 1998-12-29 "Work crew discovers a decades-old wrecked car with several skeletons inside." "Claim: Work crew discovers a decades-old wrecked car with several skeletons inside.  Example: [Brunvand, 1989]  While on a lunch break, members of a work crew were idly shoving boulders over the edge of the steep road when they suddenly heard the sound of a rock hitting metal. It turned out that buried among the jagged rocks of the roadside was a wrecked old car with 1950s Canadian license plates. Inside, still looking straight ahead, were the skeletons of four unfortunate passengers.
 Origins: Like a good many urban legends, the tale of the \"lost wreck\" reflects some societal fears that are perhaps  as old as mankind itself, primarily apprehensions about our safety when we venture out into the world alone. If something unfortunate should happen to us when we're outside the view of others, will anyone be there to come to our assistance? If we fail to return from an excursion as expected, will anyone notice we're missing, or care enough to go looking for us? Will searchers be able to find us? Could it be our chilling fate that we will simply perish in some remote place, with no one knowing or caring about our demise? As folklorist Jan Harold Brunvand notes in Curses! Broiled Again!, the modern \"lost wreck\" tale incorporates a key motif from a Scandinavian legend known since the nineteenth century, with a Norwegian version described as follows: \"Once there was a hunter who was out shooting grouse. It must have been a long time ago, for he was using a bow and arrow. He caught sight of a bird sitting in a tree a shot at it, but a strange clang was heard as though the arrow had struck a metal object. The hunter went over to see what it was, and underneath some huge trees stood an ancient church.\" The hunter had discovered the site of a village apparently completely wiped out by the plague. The metal his arrow had struck was the old churchbell. The hunter had discovered the site of a village apparently completely wiped out by the plague. The metal his arrow had struck was the old churchbell.
 Although they don't necessarily match all the details recounted in modern versions of the \"lost wreck\" legend, many true instances of long-dead bodies discovered in wrecked automobiles have been reported over the years. One of the more notable cases was that of Susie Roberts of Gainesville, Georgia, who disappeared with a friend while they were on their way home from a dance in the nearby town of Dawsonville one day in 1958. Although the friend's body turned up a year later, Roberts' body remained undiscovered until workers building a bridge found and pulled the car containing her remains from the bottom of Lake Lanier thirty-two years later. Another similar real-life version of the \"car filled with skeletons discovered by happenstance\" story would be the case of Kimberly Marie Barnes and her four friends, who disappeared from Palm Beach, Florida, in a van one summer evening in 1979. Their fate remained unknown until a mud-filled van was spotted in Palm Beach County canal by a fisherman eighteen years later; the automobile was dragged out and came within seconds of being shredded for scrap when a Miami salvage yard manager noticed a shin bone fall from the van. Investigators later found a total of five skulls inside. In September 2013, highway patrol officials who were testing new sonar equipment on Foss Lake, in a remote, sparsely populated area of southwestern Oklahoma, discovered two submerged, decades-old cars containing a total of six human skulls and matching bones. One vehicle, a 1969 Chevy Camaro, contained the remains of three Sayre, Oklahoma, teenagers who vanished on their way to a Friday night football game in 1970. The other car, a 1952 Chevy, held the remains of an Oklahoma man and two friends who disappeared in April 1969. This legend is similar in structure to Crushin' Roulette, both of them involving the discovery of long-wrecked automobiles with human remains inside. Sightings: An episode of TV's Law and Order (\"Ramparts,\" original air date 13 January 1999) opens with a van containing the skeleton of a decades-old murder victim being dredged from the Hudson River.

"Barbara Mikkelson" 1998-12-07 "The protective ghosts of little children killed at a railway crossing push stalled cars off the tracks." "This legend dates to at least the early 1970s. The horrific accident that created the protective ghosts is said to have involved an oncoming train and a schoolbus stalled on the tracks. According to widely believed lore, spirits of the slain youngsters forever after haunted that location, shoving stalled cars out of harm's way, lest more innocents share their fate. Tiny handprints on the back of the saved vehicles are a motif common to this legend and serve to explain why the stalled vehicles are magically moved. Another version has some form of tame demon assisting the dead kids in their crusade. (Hoofprints, since you asked.) Example: My cousin and I had gone to San Antonio, and we had heard rumors of some haunted railroad tracks. The story was, a school bus full of children had stalled on these tracks with a train coming. The train was going too fast for there to be time to get the children off. So they all died. When we finally found the tracks, we stopped the car, parking it right on the railroad tracks. We were both a little nervous, and scared, and waited for something to happen. Just when we were about to leave, the car started rolling. We were both too freaked out to do any more than grab each other and gasp, eyes wide, mouths open. After what seemed like an eternity, (but was actually less than 5 minutes tops) the car stopped rolling. We looked around, and we were off the railroad tracks. Now, that may not seem spooky, but what we saw next scared us enough to jump back in the car and make the 6 hour trip home THAT NIGHT. Both of us got out of the car and walked around to the back. After the first 6 hour drive, our car had accumulated quite a bit of dust on it. That's not scary, no. But what was scary was the little sets of handprints all over the back of the car. All the size of children's hands. Although the city of San Antonio has long claimed this folk tale as its own, pointing to the railway crossing where Villamain Road becomes Shane Road where cars seem to behave strangely and close to a set of streets named after children (Bobbie Allen, Cindy Sue, Laura Lee, Nancy Carole, and Richey Otis), the bus accident that sparked the legend took place in a city more than a thousand miles away. In December 1938, in Salt Lake City, Utah, twenty-six children, aged 12 to 18, lost their lives when the school bus they'd been travelling in stalled on the tracks and was struck by a freight train. No similar accident took place in San Antonio, but in 1938 that city was subjected to about ten days' worth of gruesomely detailed coverage in its local newspaper of the Salt Lake City crash, memory of which afterwards served to convince later generations the tragedy had taken place locally. San Antonio's \"ghost tracks\" are nothing more than an optical illusion. The mysterious movement of vehicles at that crossing is the result of a slight incline at the site, which works to roll vehicles that have been slipped into neutral off the tracks. As for the nearby streets supposedly christened in memoriam to the children who died, they were actually named in honor of a developer's grandchildren. The \"ghosts of schoolkids push vehicle off tracks\" group of tales is a subset of a larger group of stories, Gravity Hill tales. Many Gravity Hill factlets are offered as a \"gee whiz\" kind of thing with no storyline to them, just that if a car is slipped into neutral at the right place, it'll move as if by magic. A further subset of Gravity Hill lore involves legends about dead teens. Though we also have cars stalled on train tracks and the onrushing train killing the occupants (thus creating the helpful ghosts), others involve freeway exit ramps where it is rumored cars stopped on them will roll back uphill. The explanation offered has it that either a carload of teens heading for no particular destination or a girl on her way to the prom die in a horrible accident on that off ramp when their car stalls and is hit from behind or the brakes go and the vehicle is sent flying into the middle of the intersection at the end of the ramp where it collides with a tractor trailer. The mysterious movement of later cars is explained as the ghost(s) of the dead teen(s) attempting to push stalled vehicles out of harm's way. (For a sighting of this version of the legend, visit the Franklin Lakes Gravity Road page.) Unlike the kids on the schoolbus tales, handprints are rarely found on these rescued cars. The explanation motif (why did my car just do that?) used in this set of legends is much like that employed in the Vanishing Hitchhiker — something weird happens, the person it happened to remarks upon it in front of locals, prompting one of them to volunteer the story about the long-ago accident and the dead teen ghosts.

"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/insects-on-the-brain/" "false" "Bugs do wander into people's ears sometimes. But where can they go from there?" "David Mikkelson" 1998-12-05 "Bugs crawl into a person's ear, make their home there, then slowly eat their way through the brain." "Regarding all the nonsense about bugs in the ear: it is patently impossible for insects and/or other arthropods to enter one ear and chew through to the other; a little logic should tell us so. (Try to trace a straight course for such a journey, without going through bone.) Examples: [Collected via e-mail, July 2009] Incident One: A little boy died because surgeons found ants in his brain! Apparently this boy fell asleep with some sweets in his mouth or with some sweet stuff beside him. Ants soon got to him and some ants in fact crawled into his ear which somehow managed to go to his brain. When he woke up, he did not realize that ants had gone to his head. After that, he constantly complained about itchiness around his face. His mother brought him to a doctor, but the doctor could not figure out what was wrong with him. He took an X-ray of the boy and to his horror; he found a group of live ants in his skull. Since the ants were still alive, the doctor could not operate on him because the ants were constantly moving around. The boy finally died. So please be careful when leaving food stuff near your bed or when eating in bed. This might attract ants. Most importantly, NEVER you or your child eat sweets before going to bed. You or your child might attract ants while you are asleep. Incident Two: Another similar incident happened in a hospital in Taiwan. This man was warded in the hospital and was constantly warned by the nurses not to leave food stuff by his bedside because there were ants about. He did not heed their advice. Ants finally got to him. His family members said that the man constantly complained about headaches. He died and a postmortem or autopsy was done on him. Doctors found a group of live ants in his head. Apparently, the ants had been eating bits of his brain. So friends, better be safe than sorry. Never leave food stuff beside your bed you when you go to sleep. There are a number of flies that feed as maggots in the living tissues of vertebrates. While none seek out humans as their normal host, people are occasionally parasitized by accident. Usually their entry is through wounds, or the mucous membrane of bodily orifices. I have yet to find a reference for fly maggots in human ears. That doesn't mean it couldn't or hasn't happened, but such an infestation would be limited to soft tissue around the outer ear. (Check out any medical entomology textbook for this information: I'm going by the 6th ed. of Herms's Medical Entomology, by James and Harwood, 1969, Macmillan, New York.) <IMG HSPACE=16 VSPACE=16 WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=272 ALT=\"Cartoon of the legend\" SRC=\"https://www.snopes.com/uploads/images/horrors/graphics/bugear.jpg\" ALIGN=RIGHT style=\"border:1px solid black\"> Yes, insects and other arthropods do wander into people's ears, but not to lay eggs. The human ear can be an effective trap for small critters; the poor little dears simply blunder in and are trying to find their way out by frantically scratching around. The effect to the owner of the ear can be quite maddening, however. As an example, I offer a documented case of a fairly famous explorer getting a \"bug in his ear\" to suggest it as a possible source for the explorer part of the legend. John Hanning Speke, remembered for tracking down the source of the Nile River, recorded that the interior of his tent \"became covered with a host of small black beetles, evidently attracted by the glimmer of the candle.\" Exhausted, Speke went to sleep with them crawling over his person, only to be awakened by one of the \"horrid little insects\" struggling into his ear. Trying to remove the beetle only pushed it in further. The beetle continued into Speke's ear as far as possible, and then \"he began with exceeding vigour like a rabbit in a hole, to dig violently away at my tympanum. The queer sensation this amusing measure excited in me is past description . . . What to do I knew not.\" After trying to flush the critter out with melted butter, Speke tried to dig it out with his penknife, succeeding only in killing it and increasing the damage to his ear. Infection followed, distorting his face and causing boils. \"For many months the tumour made me almost deaf, and ate a hole between the ear and the nose, so that when I blew it, my ear whistled so audibly that those who heard it laughed. Six or seven months after this accident happened, bits of the beetle — a leg, a wing, or parts of the body — came away in the wax.\" (Quotes are from Speke's journals, as referred to in Captain Sir Richard Francis Burton by Edward Rice, 1990, Scribner's, New York.) Speke obviously survived his ordeal, and just as obviously, the beetle didn't burrow through to the other side. The incident was given a fairly prominent place in the movie Mountains of the Moon. I know the legend predates the movie, so I'm not suggesting it as a source. The story was probably better-known to Speke's contemporaries, because of the explorer's popularity. This may have been a source for at least part of the legend. Sticking bug-like in many people's minds is the memory of this legend forming the plot of a long-ago episode of Rod Serling's Night Gallery. Titled \"Caterpillar,\" it aired on 1 March 1972. In typical Night Gallery fashion, the fellow plotting someone else's downfall ended up stuck with the bug (and a pregnant one she was, too). Greatly predating Night Gallery, the Oxford English Dictionary dates the notion that an earwig penetrates into the head through the ear to as early as the year 1000. <FONT COLOR=\"\" class=\"copyright_text_color_g\"><B>Last updated:</B></FONT> &nbsp; 7 May 2015

"Barbara Mikkelson" 1998-12-04 "A cactus can explode and spew baby tarantulas everywhere." "Variations: Legends about spiders nesting in cactuses or yuccas imported from Central America surfaced in Scandinavia and Great Britain in the early 1970s.  In 1985, an outbreak of \"Spider in the Yucca\" lore featured a plant supposedly bought from Marks & Spencer, a leading British department store. Though at times this story has slipped past the watchdogs of the mainstream media and been reported as a news story, it's never been true. There has never been a spider-spewing exploding cactus, and there never will be. You see, the tale is impossible. According to Dr. Clifford S. Crawford, professor of biology at the University of New Mexico, a tarantula might possibly lay eggs or build webs on, but not in, a cactus. Curators at the Desert Museum in Tucson, Arizona, point out that tarantulas live in burrows in the ground, especially the female, which rarely moves around on the surface. No tarantulas or spiders of any type ever have been known to burrow into plants, says Rod Crawford, curator of arachnids at the Burke Museum. Even if a small spider happened to climb into a hole in a cactus and lay eggs there, he says, the plant wouldn't explode when the eggs hatched. Tarantulas take several years to reach full size. Okay, so what about scorpions? Unlike the tarantula, a scorpion and her young might seek shelter within a cactus. It is therefore theoretically possible to find a scorpion lurking in a succulent. However, hatching scorpions aren't going to come flying out of a houseplant. A scorpion's pregnancy lasts up to a year and a half. Offspring are born live and then crawl onto their mother's back for another two to six weeks of external development. The little horrors take up to seven years to mature and can live to an age of 25. At no point in their growth is there a sudden spurt that would cause a cactus to erupt. Although there haven't been any spider-filled cactuses, venomous eight-leggers have been found lurking in bunches of bananas and clusters of grapes which made their way to American consumers. Spiders can — and do — show up in shipments of fruit. Oftentimes those fruits are American-grown. Freeloading scorpions are a much rarer find, but they have been known to turn up. In 1993, a British supermarket worker was stung by one which had been napping in a bunch of bananas. In 1989, a British housewife discovered a similar hitchhiker when she began unwrapping her purchases at home. She escaped unscathed. It's a pretty clear-cut message: Leave 'foreign' things where you find them; don't bring them home. The same theme runs through The Mexican Pet legend — the cute little doggie adopted abroad turns out to be vicious sewer rat. As a final note, I leave you with this charming variant of the legend, as published in 1992 by FOAFtale News, the newsletter for the the International Society for Contemporary Legend Research: A lady buys STACKER software for her home computer, a program that compresses data on her hard disk at a ratio of 1:1.8, giving her more usable storage space. One day she finds her computer buzzing and vibrating, even though it was turned off. A computer service man warns her to leave the house at once, but before she can do so, the monitor glows green and explodes, scattering tarantulas all over the house. \"What happened is this,\" the version continues. The STACKER program was shipped from Carlsbad, CA, where these deadly arachnids are in indegenous creature. A breeding pair had inadvertently been shipped in the box with the software. When [the lady] installed STACKER on her hard disk she also unknowingly installed this pair of deadly tarantulas. Being on the same disk as STACKER, these deadly creatures were also compressed 1.8:1. That meant that by the time the full-size AT cabinet was full, there were literally millions of them. When the case ruptured, the spiders were immediately decompressed and back to the normal size . . .\" \"By the way, my lady friend only needed four pallbearers. It seems that the spider bites had compressed her 1.8 to 1.\" <FONT COLOR=\"\" class=\"copyright_text_color\" FACE=\"\" class=\"sect_font_style\"><B>Last updated:</B></FONT> &nbsp; 31 October 2006 5 December 1998 - original 31 October 2006 - reformatted" 1998 "Dec" 12 1980

"Barbara Mikkelson" 1998-12-02 "A couple's late night make-out session is cut short when they hear a report on the car radio about an escaped killer (who has a hook for a hand) in the vicinity. The girl insists on being driven home immediately; upon arrival at her house, the boy discovers a bloody hook hanging from the passenger-side car door handle." "According to popular lore, bloody hooks have been left hanging on car doors since the mid-1950s: Examples: [Baker, 1982]
This young couple is out parked on a country road. The girl is real nervous and uneasy. It seems that there had been a report about an escaped criminal in the area. He was supposed to be dangerous, a mad killer. They called him \"The Hook\" because one of his hands was missing and he wore a hook in place of it. He was supposed to have used it on all of his victims. Anyway, the girl was real uneasy for some reason. Supposedly, they were not aware of the escaped killer. She kept saying she had an uneasy feeling but she did not know why. The guy finally got mad at her. He thought she was just making up excuses because she didn't want to park. Finally he lost his temper and stepped on the gas. He really tore out of there fast. He didn't say a word on the way home. When they get to the girl's house, he just got out and went around to open her door. When he got to the door, there was a hook hanging on the handle. [Emrich, 1972]
This guy had this date with this really cool girl, and all he could think about all night was taking her out and parking and having a really good time, so he takes her out in the country, stops the car, turns the lights off, puts the radio on, nice music; he's really getting her in the mood, and all of a sudden there's this news flash comes on over the radio and says to the effect that a sex maniac has just escaped from the state insane asylum and the one distinguishing feature of this man is that he has a hook arm, and in the first place this girl is really, really upset, 'cause she's just sure this guy is going to come and try and get in their car, so the guy locks all the doors and says it'll all be okay, but she says he could take his arm and break through the window and everything and she just cries and cries and goes just really frantic and the guy finally consents to take her home, but he's really mad 'cause you know he really had his plans for this girl, so he revs up the car and he goes torquing out of there and they get to her house, and he's really, really mad and he's not even going to get out of the car and open the door for her, and she just gets out on her own side of the car and as she gets out she turns around and looks and there's a hook hanging on the door. [Dear Abby, 1960] If you are interested in teenagers, you will print this story. I don't know whether it's true or not, but it doesn't matter because it served its purpose on me. A fellow and his date pulled into their favorite \"lovers' lane\" to listen to the radio and do a little necking. The music was interrupted by an announcer who said there was an escaped convict in the area who had served time for rape and robbery. He was described as having a hook instead of a right hand. The couple became frightened and drove away. When the boy took his girl home, he went around to open the car door for her. Then he saw — a hook on the door handle! I don't think I will ever park to make out as long as I live. I hope this does the same for other kids. <img src=\"https://www.snopes.com/uploads/images/horrors/graphics/hook.jpg\" alt=\"Cartoon of the legend\" width=\"196\" height=\"270\" align=\"RIGHT\" border=\"1\" hspace=\"16\" vspace=\"16\" /> It's possible the roots of legends like The Hook and The Boyfriend's Death lie in distorted memories of real life Lover's Lane murders. There were actual cases of kids who'd gone necking coming back in pine boxes. The residue of news stories about those events would likely remain around for a while, mutating into cautionary tales with the addition of bloody hooks and scraping sounds on the roof of the car. (Click here for a fine writeup of a series of Lovers Lane murders that happened in Texarkana in 1946.) Real life roots or not, The Hook has been a legend for almost as long as anyone can remember. The key to this legend is the boyfriend's frustrated response to the girl's demand to end the date abruptly. Almost invariably, he is said to have gunned the engine and roared away. This behavior is essential to explain how the hook became ripped from the killer's arm, and to underscore the moral of the tale. The boyfriend's frustration stems from sexual denial. His girlfriend's insistence on getting home right away puts the kibosh to any randy thoughts he'd been hoping to turn into reality that night, and he's some pissed about it. \"The Hook\" is a cautionary tale about teenage sexuality. Unspoken in the story is the realization that if the girl hadn't said no, hadn't insisted upon leaving right away, the couple would have been killed. Two close calls are averted that night: the fatal encounter with the killer, and \"going all the way.\" Refusal to do one saves the pair from the other. Urban legends are often little morality plays designed to instill an important lesson about societal mores. \"The Hook\" is clearly one such tale, and its message is clear: teens shouldn't have sex. Moreover, it's up to the girl to apply the brakes. Though her boyfriend might be upset at the time, not long after he'll understand the wisdom of her refusal and thank her for it. Or at least so says the legend. Barbara \"no nooky, no hooky\" MikkelsonSightings: Look for this tale in the 1972 M.E. Keer novel Dinky Hocker Shoots Smack! and in Stephen King's 1981 Danse Macabre. You'll also find mentions of it in the 1979 comedy Meatballs, the 1992 film Candyman, the 1997 slasher classic I Know What You Did Last Summer, and 1998's Urban Legend. <span class=\"copyright_text_color\"><b>Last updated:</b></span> &nbsp; 2 June 2008

"Barbara Mikkelson" 1998-12-01 "Analysis of restaurant food eaten by a young woman reveals the presence of semen from HIV- or STD-positive men." "Claim: Analysis of restaurant food eaten by a young woman reveals the presence of semen from HIV- or STD-positive men. FALSE Examples:   A Michigan woman was in disgust last week when she ate at a local McDonald's. Lisa McDowell, 31, was having lunch with her friends when she decided to order a McChicken sandwich. She was halfway through with her sandwich when she noticed an extra clump of mayonnaise on the side of the bun. She licked it off, tasted it and immediately realized things were not right. \"I'm not gonna lie,\" McDowell said. \"On Birthdays and holidays I give my man a little something extra in the bedroom, you know? So when I licked the mayo off of the bun, the texture was familiar.\" McDowell immediately called over the manager who denied the allegations, so she contacted the local health department. They sent the \"mayo\" remains off for testing and the results were positive for 2 different types of semen. To make matters worse, in the following days, McDowell woke with a giant red rash on the corner of her mouth. The rash spread and developed into severe blisters. The doctor was able to verify that she had contracted the herpes virus, which she claims was a result of her tainted McChicken.
The manager confirmed that two employees were fired as a result of her allegations and the positive semen test results. The manager of the McDonald’s also added, \"We can't always keep an eye on our employee's conduct. We can only hope, during the interview process, that we are able to hire employees that meet our companies standards.\"
 
 [Collected on the Internet, 1993] Here's a true story that happened in Holland: After a night out a couple went to eat some shoarma (roasted lamb-meat in a Pita roll, preferably with lots of garlic-sauce. Shoarma restaurants are the only ones still open after, say, 2.00 a.m., so after a lot of drinking, if still hungry, it's the only place.) Typically in these places you get served by mediterranean (Turkish or Moroccan) types hardly able to speak dutch, and in the middle of the night every guest eating there is drunk and noisy. So anyway, these youngsters ate their weekend portion of half raw meat, but only the guy didn't take the garlic sauce. Later that night the girl got very sick, and went to first aid to get her stomach pumped. After analysis of her stomach contents, it was found that the garlic sauce she had eaten contained ten(!) different Quacks of semen, later to be traced to the owner and nine employees of the shoarma joint. This Sperm-O-Rama was later closed on police order.
 
 [Collected on the Internet, 1997] Heard a story about a friend of a friend who one day decided to eat Chinese food for lunch. A few days later she developed sores on her mouth. She went to the doctor, who determined that she had a malicious form of herpes. She was perplexed by this diagnosis because she was faithful to her husband. After she confronted her husband the doctor's diagnosis, he assured her that he didn't commit any infidelity and would submit to a test to prove it. He took the test and was found clean. All this, taking the span of three days or so, the perplexed couple looked everywhere for an answer. They took a sample of the leftover chinese food into the lab, where semen was found in it - this semen being the source of the herpes.
 
 [Collected on the Internet, 1993] There is a street in South Shields in Newcastle, UK, that is supposed to have a record amount of Indian restaurants in it. There was a story circulating recently about some lads who ordered a take away late at night, rather the worse (or better) for wear after a night on the town. They all went home that night and devoured their curries, except one guy who fell asleep. The next day he awoke and decided to have curry for breakfast, but upon opening his decided that something looked dubious about it. He got a friend who was a medical student to examine it, and discovered it contained FIVE different semen samples.
 Variations:
       Origins: This legend about HIV-infected food has been with us since at least 1989. It's a favorite of high school and college students and says a lot about how we feel about fast food and what we fear might be in it. Upon hearing the tale, one doesn't know which to be more disgusted by: the presence of semen in food (someone jerked off into our lunch!), or the presence of a horrible disease (we run the risk of contamination every time we buy our lunch instead of bringing it from home). As widespread a tale as this is, it's most certainly false. Consider this: even if a dread disease had been found in foodstuffs ingested by the anonymous victim, who would have checked it for semen? It's not a typical substance you'd expect a doctor or testing facility to go looking for when presented with suspect food. Also, even if semen were found, how would anyone know it came from seven different guys? A DNA analysis? Think of it this way: if you were suddenly taken ill and suspected there was something wrong with whatever you'd just eaten, the tests that would be run on you would check for salmonella, e.coli, or other typical food poisoning culprits. You wouldn't expect anyone to go looking for HIV or herpes (at least until you manifested symptoms of them), much less semen. (Also, many infectious agents, such as HIV, wouldn't survive for long outside a human host, especially after having been put through a cooking process.) In British versions, the contaminated food is curry or shawarma, takeaway foods that are perceived as unmistakably foreign (and therefore suspect). American tellings of the legend spread the story across the full range of fast food, everything from Chinese to tacos and hamburgers, making it more a \"fear of fast food\" tale than one of xenophobia. With few exceptions, the ingester of the semen-enhanced food is female. The innocuous process of eating puts the semen of strange men in her mouth, which is in itself the breaking of a sexual taboo. There's a sense of violation to this legend, of the victim having unwittingly had oral/genital contact with a stranger. Adding to the first \"Eww!\" factor is the possibility of catching a horrible disease merely through the act of satisfying one's hunger. These days having unprotected sex can kill, and we all know that. Legends like this one play upon our fears that even if we do everything right, a dread disease might get us anyway. In decades gone by, just the thought that someone had spit into our food was a major gross-out, and the idea that a crazed restaurant worker might have randomly slipped poison into our meal would strike terror in our hearts. Now we're gastronomically terrorized by that bogeyman of the 1990s, infectious diseases (particularly AIDS), and the delivery vehicle of choice (semen) is a constant reminder that the bogeyman's henchmen are sexual deviants as well as killers. Barbara \"minding herpes and queues\" Mikkelson 
Update: July 2007 saw the spread of a variant of this legend, one which claimed that a girl was diagnosed with \"syphilis in her mouth\" after she ate at an Olive Garden outlet (in West Des Moines, Iowa), and her food \"tested positive for three different types of semen\": A girl I work with and her friend went to Olive Garden this weekend; I believe Thursday or Friday night. Amber’s friend did not get what she ordered correctly so she sent the food back. Sunday she woke up and had red bumps all over inside her mouth. She went to the doctor and after many questions and food allergy tests she brought in what she had ate (she had left over’s at home) the doctor tested it. The food tested positive for three different types of semen, Amber's friend had Syphilis in her mouth from the food at Olive Garden here in WDSM. Olive Garden management and health officials were quick to point out that the rumor was false: Urban myth e-mail messages can travel quickly and leave businesses in damage-control mode. A central Iowa restaurant is coping with the fallout of a hoax e-mail. Recent e-mails mention the the Olive Garden in West Des Moines, which often has a waiting list. But lately, calls to the restaurant have not been about seating. The e-mail stated that a customer sent her food back to the kitchen and that two days later, the girl woke up with syphilis in her mouth. A doctor tested the leftover food and found body fluids on it, according to the e-mail. The Iowa Department of Public Health said there is no way that the e-mail is true. A manager at the Olive Garden said employees are continuing to reassure concerned customers that the rumor is false. Health officials said the Olive Garden has a clean record and that there is no cause for concern. A central Iowa restaurant is coping with the fallout of a hoax e-mail.

"Barbara Mikkelson" 1998-11-17 "An abused goat kills its owner ... and then is saved from destruction by animal lovers." "Claim: An abused goat kills its owner ... and then is saved from destruction by animal lovers. TRUE Origins: Carl Hulsey was determined to turn his white billy goat, Snowball, into a watchdog, whether Snowball wanted to be one or not. To that end, 77-year-old  Hulsey, a retired poultry worker from Canton, Georgia, took to beating Snowball with a stick to make him more aggressive. \"Pa, this goat's going to kill you if you keep that up,\" Alma Hulsey warned her husband. She was right. On 16 May 1991, Hulsey once again approached the goat, brandishing a stick. This time Snowball landed the first blow. The 110-pound goat attacked his tormentor, butting Hulsey in the stomach, twice knocking him down. Hulsey scrambled onto the porch in an effort to get away. The goat bounded up the steps after him. While Alma Hulsey watched, Snowball rammed his master over the edge. Hulsey fell to the ground five feet below and died where he landed. \"Blunt trauma to the abdominal cavity,\" said the coroner. Snowball had ruptured Hulsey's stomach. Domesticated animals that kill human beings, as Snowball did, are often deemed dangerous and put down. Once the goat's story was known, however, the officials who were to decide Snowball's fate were inundated with pleas to spare the creature. More than 500 protesters from around the nation called Cherokee County animal control after it was announced Snowball might be put to death. Many offered to adopt Snowball. Some even made death threats. \"What happens to the goat happens to you,\" one caller reportedly warned. There was also talk of a bomb being planted if the goat didn't walk. Snowball got his reprieve. He was turned over to Noah's Ark, a private animal shelter for neglected and abused animals in Locust Grove, a little town south of Atlanta. Four hours after his arrival, he was laid on a kitchen table and neutered, an operation intended to make him less aggressive. He was also rechristened \"Snow.\" Why this furor over a goat and the seeming lack of concern for the man whose life it had ended? In the small community Hulsey had been part of, he was well and truly mourned. Yet outside that pocket of acquaintance, sentiment ran the other way — many animal lovers saw a certain divine justice in his fate. He'd brought harm to an animal, and the animal had struck back. As Tom Teepen, editor of the editorial pages of The Atlanta Constitution, noted: We are keener to understand and spare an abused goat than an abused human. Indeed, when a human kills, we sneer at his defense as a dodge — 'Yeah, yeah sure, his mother didn't love him' — yet we are sentimental about killer goats. We are a very strange animal.

"Barbara Mikkelson" 1998-11-17 "The \"hanging man\" in a funhouse turns out to be the corpse of an outlaw." "Claim: The \"hanging man\" in a funhouse turns out to be the corpse of an outlaw. Status: True. Origins: In December 1976 a Universal Studios camera crew arrived at the Nu-Pike Amusement Park in Long Beach, California, to film an episode of the television action show, the  Six Million Dollar Man. In preparing the set in a corner of the funhouse, a worker moved the \"hanging man,\" causing one of this prop's arms to come off. Inside it was human bone. This was no mere prop; this was a dead guy! The body was that of Elmer McCurdy, a young man who in 1911 robbed a train of $46 and two jugs of whiskey in Oklahoma. He announced to the posse in pursuit of him that he would not be taken alive. He was proved right — they killed him in the ensuing shoot-out. McCurdy began his career as a sideshow attraction right after his embalming. He looked so darned good dressed up in his fancy clothes that the undertaker propped him up in a corner of the funeral home's back room and charged locals a nickel to see \"The Bandit Who Wouldn't Give Up.\" The nickels were dropped into the corpse's open mouth (from where they were later retrieved by the entreprenurial undertaker). No next of kin showed up to claim McCurdy, so the corpse kept mouthing nickels for a few years. Carnival promoters wanted to buy the stiff, but the undertaker turned them down. McCurdy was producing a steady income for the funeral parlor — why tamper with success? In 1915, two men showed up and claimed that McCurdy was their brother. They hauled the body away, supposedly to give him a decent burial in the family plot. In reality, McCurdy's \"brothers\" were carnival promoters and this was a ruse to get the deceased away from that proprietary undertaker. The promotors exhibited McCurdy throughout Texas under the same billing as the undertaker had given him — \"The Bandit Who Wouldn't Give Up.\" After that tour, McCurdy popped up everywhere, including an amusement park near Mount Rushmore, lying in an open casket in a Los Angeles wax museum, and in a few low-budget films. Before the Six Million Dollar Man crew discovered this prop to be a corpse, McCurdy had been hanging in that Long Beach funhouse for four years. In April 1977, the much-traveled Elmer McCurdy was laid to final rest in Summit View Cemetery in Guthrie, Oklahoma. To make sure the corpse would not make its way back to the entertainment world, the state medical examiner ordered two cubic yards of cement poured over the coffin before the grave was closed. McCurdy hasn't been seen hanging around amusement parks since.

"David Mikkelson" 1998-11-03 "Several students tripping on LSD stared at the sun until blinded." "Claim: Several students tripping on LSD stared at the sun until blinded. Status: False. Origins: This  legend, one the 1960s' most ubiquitous pieces of drug scarelore (along with \"teenager on acid trip thinks he can fly and jumps out window\") was nothing but pure hoax. Nonetheless, the national print media fell for it twice. This twisted tale was born on Thursday, 18 May 1967, when California newspapers began reporting a horrific tale concerning some Santa Barbara college students who damaged their eyes by staring at the sun while they were under the influence of LSD. Here's how the story was written up by the Los Angeles Times: FROM SUN GAZING WHILE ON 'TRIP' Four LSD Users Suffer Serious Eye Damage Exclusive to The Times from a Staff Writer SANTA BARBARA — Four college students have suffered permanent impairment of vision as a result of staring at the sun while under the influence of LSD, according to a spokesman for the Santa Barbara Ophthalmological Society. One of the youths told his doctor he was \"holding a religious conversation with the sun.\" Another said he had gazed at the sun \"to produce unusual visual displays.\" The students, all males, suffered damage to the retina, the sensory membrane which receives the image formed by the lens. In the same way that a piece of paper will burn when bright light is beamed through a magnifying glass, a pinhead-size hole was burned into the retina of each eye of the students as sunlight passed through the lens. What this has left the students with is not total blindness but a blind spot in the center of their vision. As a result, the victims have lost their reading vision completely and forever, the ophthalmological spokesman said. \"For example, if you wanted to read,\" he said, \"you might see all of the corners of the page and most of the print — except you wouldn't be able to see that one word you were looking at. \"If you were to look at a traffic stoplight, you might see the pole and trees and cars — but you wouldn't see the stoplight itself. \"That little black hole always moves directly where you want to see,\" he said. Solar burns of the retina, the spokesman said, are not uncommon, particularly among children watching eclipses of the sun. But he knew of no previous cases which resulted from someone being under the influence of LSD. In the cases here, the victims admitted they were users of LSD. Three of them attend UC Santa Barbara, the other goes to Santa Barbara City College. Their ages range from 18 to 24. The spokesman said it was his impression that each of the sun-staring incidents occurred separately. He did not know whether the students knew each other. The four had no awareness of pain or discomfort while the sun was burning through the eye tissue, the spokesman said. The damage is permanent, because tissue so damaged does not regenerate itself.

 Do you recall the first of those six one-word interrogatives all good journalists are supposed to ask? Good.  Now ask yourself, what the heck happened to the who in this story? Not a SINGLE NAME is mentioned anywhere in the article! None of the students is identified, none of the doctors who presumably treated them is named, the ophthamologist quoted at length is never referred to any more specifically than \"a spokesman,\" and even the reporter (\"a staff writer\") remains anonymous. How is it that this unidentified reporter managed to procure bizarre quotes from the alleged victims (e.g., \"I was holding a religious conversation with the sun\") yet failed to gather any other basic information, such as the students' names or places of residence? Why is it that no mention is made of the medical facility where these students were presumably treated? How come the \"spokesman for the Santa Barbara Ophthalmological Society,\" who is quoted at length, is never identified? This story has HOAX written all over it, even before we consider the implausibility of four students' independently staring at the sun until their retinas burned, all on the same day in the same town. (A similar article from the San Francisco Chronicle, also credited to an anonymous \"correspondent,\" mentions that the ophthamologist \"would not be identified,\" and that he \"refused to reveal the victims' identity.\") The LSD horror story was picked up by the Associated Press and quickly spread all over the U.S., appearing in such prominent news publications such as The New York Times and Time magazine. One might expect that even though these staid news journals were taken in by the hoax, they learned their lesson when no more details were forthcoming. (We saw, for example, no follow-up articles describing how these students were coping with their impaired vision, nor did the press offer any rueful \"I'll never use drugs again\" comments from any of the unfortunate victims once they'd had time to reflect on their foolishness.) It took a scant eight months before the media were trumpeting the same headline again. Here's an Associated Press dispatch as it appeared in the Los Angeles Times on 13 January 1968: 6 College Men Take LSD, Blinded by Sun WASHINGTON (AP) — Six college men suffered total and permanent blindness by staring at the sun while under the influence of the drug LSD, it was learned Friday. The six, all juniors at a western Pennsylvania college that officials decline to name, lost their sight after they took the hallucinatory drug together last spring. Norman M. Yoder, commissioner of the Office of the Blind in the Pennsylvania State Welfare Department, said the retinal areas of the youths' eyes were destroyed. Federal officials questioned about the case said it is the first they have heard of in which total blindness resulted. The only similar case officials knew of was one reported last May in which four students at the University of California at Santa Barbara suffered permanent loss of their reading vision by staring at the sun after taking LSD. Lie on backs in Sun Yoder said in a telephone interview from Harrisburg that the Pennsylvania students all had taken LSD at least once before. He said they went to a grassy area in a woodland about half a mile from the college and took the drug there. Then, he said, they all lay on their backs in the grass \"and were not consciously looking at the sun.\" The youths were found at the scene, blind and helpless, the afternoon of the same day by fellow students who knew of the \"trip\" plans. Those using the drug had been gone about six hours. Yoder said the youths didn't even realize they were staring at the sun \"until they came out of the trance,\" but that they had come to their senses when the other students arrived. The afflicted students have since been receiving rehabilitation services of the Pennsylvania Welfare Department. WASHINGTON (AP) — Six college men suffered total and permanent blindness by staring at the sun while under the influence of the drug LSD, it was learned Friday. The six, all juniors at a western Pennsylvania college that officials decline to name, lost their sight after they took the hallucinatory drug together last spring. Norman M. Yoder, commissioner of the Office of the Blind in the Pennsylvania State Welfare Department, said the retinal areas of the youths' eyes were destroyed. Federal officials questioned about the case said it is the first they have heard of in which total blindness resulted. The only similar case officials knew of was one reported last May in which four students at the University of California at Santa Barbara suffered permanent loss of their reading vision by staring at the sun after taking LSD.

The afflicted students have since been receiving rehabilitation services of the Pennsylvania Welfare Department.
 First of all, notice that the ante has been upped: now there are six students; the victims have been made completely blind; and, as Newsweek described it, this tragedly befell engineering students who were \"nice kids, not hippies\" (unlike those California freaks who blathered on about having \"religious conversations with the sun\"). And once again, there's that nagging non-specificity of detail: the students, their school, their rescuers, the doctors who treated them, and the medical facility where they were taken are all unnamed. The spokesman is identified this time, but as we're about to see, Dr. Norman M. Yoder is not quite a reliable source. Although the incident in Pennsylvania was reported as a breaking news story, it had allegedly occurred 20 months earlier (in April 1966). Dr. Yoder, blind from childhood due to an accident, had attended a lecture on the \"dangers of LSD\" in the autumn of 1967, and shortly afterwards he mentioned the story of the blinded students to Joseph Hunt, the commissioner of the Rehabilitation Service Administration, an office of the federal cabinet's Department of Health, Education and Welfare. Hunt asked Yoder for a written account of the incident, and Yoder complied by submitting actual case studies of six blind students (with the students' names covered over), all of whom were reportedly receiving state aid. This \"report\" was leaked to an Associated Press reporter who released it to the media on 13 January 1968, and outraged government officials took quick action. The next day the Federal Drug Administration announced it would conduct an investigation and prosecute the persons who had supplied LSD to the blinded students. On January 16, Pennsylvania state senator Benjamin R. Donolow and the press secretary for vacationing Pennsylvania governor Raymond P. Shafer both stated at news conferences that the story was true, as did Governor Shafer himself on January 17. Some sensible skeptics managed to make themselves heard, however. Ophthamologists expressed their doubts that even LSD could override self-preservation instincts long enough to keep a person's eyes focused on the sun until retinal tissues burned, or that such an occurrence could have remained unreported twenty months later. And when investigators began to check on the case reports offered by Dr. Yoder, they found several damning inconsistencies: one of the \"victims\" had been receiving state aid since before April 1966, and another hadn't even been a student at the time of the alleged blindings. Yoder admitted on January 18 that he had made the whole thing up because of his \"concern over illegal LSD use by children.\" The \"distraught and upset\" Commissioner Yoder was immediately suspended from his post as he checked himself into the Philadelphia Psychiatric Center, where he spent four weeks before being permanently removed from his position with the Welfare Department. (Although Dr. Norman Yoder is the name now mentioned whenever this story is discussed, the creation of this legend should be credited to the anonymous hoaxster[s] who had planted the \"blinded students\" articles in California newspapers eight months earlier.) As usual, the unraveling of the legend received far less attention from the press than its sensational outbreak had produced, and it remained a widely believed drug horror story throughout the next decade. (Newsweek reluctantly printed a tiny retraction in response to a reader who wrote them that \"the entire affair was the ill-conceived hoax of individuals who possibly share your zealotry for evoking before the public's terror-charged eyes the many perils presumably awaiting the hallucinogenic traveler.\") Joel Fort provided an apt and succinct commentary on this legend in his 1969 book The Pleasure Seekers: No instances of blindness have been shown to result from LSD use, but, of course, there are millions of blind people and hundreds of known causes of blindness which the public and press have shown much less concern about than the propaganda associating LSD with this severe disability. The propensity of the mass media uncritically to accept lurid and sensationalistic stories emanating from generally untrustworthy and uninformed government sources is probably far more dangerous to our social fabric than LSD. Printers' ink in one sense is the most dangerous chemical in use. Sightings: In episode #36 of Dragnet 1967, Sgt. Joe Friday makes reference to those poor kids in Santa Barbara who went blind from staring into the sun. Last updated: 29 January 2007

While we can establish that the car in question does now indeed reside in a Viennese museum, no other part of the tale has been confirmed.

Sarajevo then was in Bosnia and Herzegovina, a state recently annexed by the imperial court of Vienna.

More catastrophic still, this event was to trigger the First World War. General Potiorek became the next owner of the car. Several weeks into the war his armies suffered a rout at the hands of the ill-organised army of Serbia. The General was summoned back to Vienna by the Emperor Franz Josef I. And there in Vienna, his reputation ruined, his sanity destroyed, he died. [Another version adds the detail of Potiorek becoming an impoverished lunatic who eventually died in the almshouse.] A captain of Potiorek's staff took charge of the jinxed vehicle; nine days later in a terrible accident he killed two peasants on the road before swerving into a tree and killing himself. After the war, the governor of newly independent Yugoslavia took charge of the car. He endured a succession of terrible accidents, one of which cost him his left arm. [Four accidents in four months, according to another source.] The car was then sold to a doctor, who was crushed to death when he overturned it into a ditch.

[Thrown over a stone wall to his death, says another source.] A Serbian farmer, who paid a fantastic sum for the car which had acquired great historical value, was the next owner and victim. He cadged a tow from a horse and cart one morning because the engine would not turn over. He forgot to switch off the ignition and the engine caught suddenly. The car lurched forward into the horse and cart, and overturned, killing the farmer. Finally, a garage owner lost his life in the car returning from a wedding. He tried to overtake a long line of vehicles and was killed as the car spun out of control. [On his way to the wedding, says the other version.

"Barbara Mikkelson" 1998-10-29 "The ghost of a disappointed lover haunts the Toys 'R' Us store in Sunnyvale, California." "If you like a good ghost story, this tale is for you: Enter the Play-Doh aisle at your own risk. Browse the children's books with caution. And don't even ask to go upstairs, where the toys are stacked. The Toys 'R' Us in Sunnyvale is haunted by a man named Johnson, employees and psychics say. \"I don't believe in ghosts,\" said Putt-Putt O'Brien, who has spent 18 years stacking toys at the store. \"But you feel a breeze behind you. Someone calls your name and there's nobody there. Funny things happen here that you can't explain.\" Rag dolls and toy trucks leap off shelves. Balls bounce down the aisles. Children's books fall out of racks. Baby swings move on their own. The folks at Toys 'R' Us say they've tried to explain it logically but can't. \"Many people have experiences, not just one or two of us,\" O'Brien said. \"He's like Casper. Nothing he does ever hurt anybody.\" Others have taken notice, too. Newspapers have written about him. The toy store has been featured on television's That's Incredible and other shows. A Hollywood script writer for the movie Toys spent two nights inside doing research. Psychic Sylvia Browne held a seance there in 1978 and has been back a dozen times. Browne said Johnson told her he was a preacher and ranch hand in the 1880s on the Murphy family farm, where the toy store sits today. He spoke with a mild Swedish accent, and his first name was John, Yon, or Johan. Ten of sixteen people assembled there for the seance said they heard a \"high buzzing noise\" when Browne was supposedly listening to the ghost. Browne said the ghost told her he had been in love with Murphy's daughter Elizabeth, who ran off with an East Coast lawyer. Old news clippings say Johnson accidentally hacked his leg with an ax while carelessly chopping down trees. Another story said Johnson was found dead in the orchard with an ax wound in his neck. Both stories say he bled to death. O'Brien said she saw Johnson once: A young man in his 20s or 30s, wearing knickers, a white long-sleeved work shirt, and a gray tweed snap-brim cap, walked past her. Another time she heard the sound of galloping horses. \"Yohan used to exercise the horses, they say,\" O'Brien said. Now he apparently gets his exercise playing with the staff. There was the time when men were waxing the floor, for instance, and a teddy bear kept appearing in each aisle as they moved their equipment through the store. There's the overwhelming sweet smell of garden flowers that haunts Aisle 15C, next to the Mickey Mouse dolls and the Batman toothbrush sets. So, now the obvious question: Is it all just a desperate sales gimmick? \"It's very good publicity for us,\" said store director Stephanie Lewis. \"But I personally don't believe in it.\" But even if Lewis doesn't believe it, others do. \"Last week we had to chase three or four teenagers away,\" she said. \"They were sitting out front at 4 a.m. with a Ouija board, trying to conjure up the ghost. Once a week someone comes in here asking about it. Teenagers beg us to let them spend the night on the floor.\" \"I have employees who will not go into the women's bathroom alone,\" Lewis said. That's because Johnson follows them in there and turns on the water faucets, she said. Longtime employees say Johnson has also pulled pranks on contractors who come to do short-term jobs. They see a toy leap from a shelf and refuse to come back. O'Brien believes Johnson lives upstairs in a breezy, cool corner. The pranks he pulls upstairs are also harmless, she said, but it's spookier because one is usually alone. \"When I go up there, I'll say, 'Johan, I'm only here to work,'\" O'Brien said. So if the place is haunted, why stick around? \"It's a good ghost,\" said Lisa, another employee, who didn't give her last name. \"It's fun here.\"" 1998 "Oct" 10 1970

"David Mikkelson" 1998-09-28 "A photograph shows the aftermath of a grisly tug-of-war contest in which two men lost their arms." "On 25 October 1997, a mass tug-of-war contest was held at a park along the Keelung River in Taipei in celebration of Retrocession Day (the 52nd anniversary of the end of the Japanese colonial rule in Taiwan). Over 1,600 participants joined in the contest, exerting an estimated 80,000 kg or more of force on a 5-cm nylon rope that could bear a force of about 26,000 kg at most. Within seconds the rope snapped, severing the left arms of two men, Yang Chiung-ming and Chen Ming-kuo, below the shoulder. (The severing of their limbs was believed to have been caused by sheer rebounding force of the broken rope rather than the men's having wrapped the rope around their arms, as was sometimes reported.) The victims were taken to Mackay Memorial Hospital and underwent seven hours of microsurgery to reattach their arms:  A similar but less severe set of injuries occurred during a February 2013 incident in Southern California, when two students at South El Monte High School lost fingers during a tug-of-war contest: A teenage boy and girl were in stable condition after their fingers were severed during a game of tug-of-war at South El Monte High School. The accident happened during a lunchtime spirit week celebration at the school. \"They wrapped the rope around their hands and somehow the rope when on to snap, I guess it created some extra tension and caused the injuries,\" Los Angeles County Fire Inspector Brian Riley said. Students \"cheered at first because they thought it was funny that the rope broke, but then they realized what really happened,\" freshman Allene Garcia said. The victims were identified by classmates as Edith Rodriguez and Pablo Ocegueda. \"They were just both in shock, staring at their hands. They didn’t know what to do,\" Jennifer Jiminez, also a freshman, said." 1998 "Sep" 9 1990

"Barbara Mikkelson" 1998-09-21 "A policeman stalks a young girl on the Internet to show her how easily even the most innocuous information can be used to find someone in real life." "Claim: A policeman stalks a young girl on the Internet to show her how easily even the most innocuous information can be used to find someone in real life. Status: False. Example: [Collected on the Internet, 1998]  Once inside she leaned against the door for a moment, relieved to be in the safety of her home. She glanced out the window to see if anyone was there. The sidewalk was empty. After tossing her books on the sofa she decided to grab a snack and get on line. There she could talk to strangers without being afraid. After all, no one knew who she really was and couldn't hurt her. She logged on under her screen name \"ByAngel213\". Checking her Buddy List she saw GoTo123 was on. She sent him an instant message: ByAngel213: Hi I'm glad you are on! I thought someone was following me home today. It was really weird! GoTo123: LOL You watch too much TV. Why would someone be following you? Don't you live in a safe neighborhood? ByAngel213: Of course I do... LOL... I guess it was my imagination... cause I didn't see anybody when I looked out. GoTo123: Unless you gave your name out on line... You haven't done that have you? ByAngel213: Of course not. I'm not stupid you know. GoTo123: Did you have a softball game after school today? ByAngel213: Yes and we won!! GoTo123: That's great! Who did you play? ByAngel213: We played the Hornets... LOL..their uniforms are so gross! They look like bees... LOL GoThere123: What is your team called? ByAngel213: We are the Canton Cats. We have tiger paws on our uniforms. They are really kewl. GoTo123: Do you pitch or what? ByAngel213: No... I play second base. I got to go.. My homework has to be done before my parents get home. I don't want them mad at me...Bye GoTo123: Catch you later.. Bye GoTo123 decided it was time to teach Angel a lesson. One she would never forget. He went to the member menu and began to search for her profile. When it came up he highlighted it and printed it out. He took out a pen and began to write down what he knew about Angel so far. Her name: Shannon. Birthday: Jan. 3, 1985. Age:13. State where she lived: North Carolina. Hobbies: softball, chorus, skating and going to the mall. Besides this information he knew she lived in Canton. She had just told him. He knew she stayed by herself until 6:30 every afternoon until her parents came home from work. He knew she played softball on Thursday afternoons on the school team and the team was named the Canton Cats. Her favorite number 7 was printed on her jersey. He knew she was in the seventh grade at the Canton Junior High School. She had told him all this in the conversations they had on line. He had enough information to find her now. \"She'll be so surprised,\" he thought, \"she doesn't even know what she has done.\" Shannon didn't tell her parents about the incident on the way home from the ball park that day. She didn't want them to make a scene and stop her from walking home from the softball games. Parents were always overreacting and hers were the worst. It made her wish she was not an only child. Maybe if she had brothers and sisters her parents wouldn't be so overprotective. By Thursday Shannon had forgotten about the footsteps following her. Her game was in full swing when suddenly she felt someone staring at her. It was then that the memory came back. She glanced up from her second base position to see a man watching her closely. He was leaning against the fence behind first base and he smiled when she looked at him. He didn't look scary and she quickly dismissed the fear she had felt. After the game he sat on a bleacher while she talked to the coach. She noticed his smile once again as she walked past him. He nodded and she smiled back. He noticed her name on back of the shirt. He knew he had found her. Quietly he walked a safe distance behind her. He didn't want to frighten her and have to explain what he was doing to anyone. It was only a few blocks to Shannon's home and once he saw where she lived he quickly returned to the park to get his car. Now he had to wait. He decided to get a bite to eat until the time came to go to Shannon's house. He drove to a fast food restaurant and sat there until time to make his move. Shannon was in her room later that evening when she heard voices in the living room. Shannon, come here,\" her father called. He sounded upset and she couldn't imagine why. She went into the room to see the man from the ballpark sitting on the sofa. \"Sit down,\" her father began, \"this man is a policeman and he has just told us a most interesting story about you.\" Shannon moved cautiously to a chair across from the man. How could he tell her parents anything? She had never seen him before today! \"Do you know who I am Shannon?\" The man asked. \"No...\" Shannon answered. \"I am your on line friend, GoTo123.\" Shannon was stunned. \"That's impossible! GoTo is a kid my age! He's 14 and he lives in Michigan!\" The man smiled. \"I know I told you all that... but it wasn't true. You see, Shannon, there are people on line who pretend to be kids; I was one of them. But while others do it to find kids and hurt them, I belong to a group of parents who do it to protect kids from predators. I came here to find you to teach you how dangerous it is to give out too much information to people online. You told me enough about yourself to make it easy for me to find you. Your name, the school you went to, the name of your ball team and the position you played. The number and name on your jersey just made finding you a breeze.\" Shannon was stunned. \"You mean you don't live in Michigan?\" He laughed. \"No, I live in Raleigh. It made you feel safe to think I was so far away, didn't it?\" She nodded. \"I had a friend whose daughter was like you. Only she wasn't as lucky. The guy found her and murdered her while she was home alone. Kids are taught not to tell anyone when they are alone, yet they do it all the time on line. The wrong people trick you into giving out information a little here and there online. Before you know it, you have told them enough for them to find you without even realizing you have done it. I hope you've learned a lesson from this and won't do it again.\" \"I won't,\" Shannon promised solemnly. \"Will you tell others about this so they will be safe too?\" It's a promise!\" That night Shannon and her dad and Mom all knelt down together and prayed. They thanked God for protecting Shannon from what could have been a tragic situation.
 Origins: Though the preceding tale is related on a number of web sites as a true story, it's not. Written by two Christians concerned about the danger unwittingly presented by young people giving out too much personal information online, this cautionary tale first surfaced on the Internet in January 1998. The authors very clearly stated the Shannon story was not true, but that part of the e-mail was seemingly lost in the first volley of forwards. Perhaps people were so enthralled with story itself they forgot to include the rest of the information given by the authors, which included their reasons for writing the parable and an 8-point list of good suggestions kids would do well to adhere to in the world of cyberspace:         For more information about the authors and the history of this piece of netlore, visit their

"Barbara Mikkelson" 1998-08-09 "The 1867 wedding of a princess and a duke was marred by tragedy on an unprecedented scale." "The truthfulness of events related in this legend is extremely doubtful, but since we've heard the tale from a number of different sources, we present it here without making any claims as to how real it might be: When the princess Maria del Pozzo della Cisterna wed the duke of D'Aosta, son of the King of Italy, on 30 May 1867, the festivities were marred by such a tragic tangle of events that the royal family suppressed the truth lest the very news bring misfortune to the couple's life. The ominous events began before the wedding when the bride's wardrobe mistress hanged herself, prompting the superstitious princess to order a new gown. The ceremony itself was delayed twice. First, the mounted officer appointed to lead the wedding procession from the palace to the church suffered sunstroke and collapsed. Then the palace gates failed to open for the matrimonial procession. The gatekeeper was found nearby, lying in a pool of blood. Fate tendered a reprieve during the ceremony but minutes later the best man — probably ineptly handling his ceremonial weapon — shot himself in the head. Eventually the bride and groom were escorted by a procession of carriages to the railway station where the royal newlyweds were to board a train for their honeymoon. More trouble dogged their footsteps. The officer who had drawn up the marriage contract suffered a stroke and the anxious stationmaster fell under the wheels of the approaching bridal locomotive. King Victor Emmanuel, by now dishonoured by the series of misfortunes and convinced that the ceremony and everything associated with it was jinxed, refused to allow anyone aboard the train and tried desparately to return the procession to the safety of the palace. But it was not to be. Riding alongside the bridal carriage, the count of Castiglione fell from his horse underneath the carriage's wheels. The count died when the weight of the wheels drove a splendid medal through his uniform into his chest." 1998 "Aug" 8 1860

"Snopes Staff" 1998-03-01 "Madmen are injecting HIV-infected blood into unsuspecting moviegoers and random young people dancing in bars or at raves." "In June 2018, the Feedy TV web site published an article headlined \"HIV Infected Needles Found in Public: Take Only 2 Minutes of Your Time to Save Your Life.\" The text of the article recounted supposedly recent incidents of unsuspecting persons being jabbed with HIV-infected needles left in movie theater seats in various cities: Recently, a girl who went to the movies, sat down in one of the theater seats, and felt a stabbing pain. She quickly stood up and found the needle of a medical syringe sticking out of the seat. There was also a note that said, “You have been infected with HIV”. The Centers for Disease Control reports that similar events have taken place in several other cities recently. All of the needles tested HAVE been positive for HIV. The CDC also reports that needles have been found in the coin return areas of pay phones and soda machines. This article was nothing more than a modern recounting of an urban legend about \"AIDS terrorists\" randomly pricking victims with HIV-infected needles in theaters and other public places, a legend that first hit the Internet two decades ago: [Collected on the Internet, 1998] Warning - MUST READ Be careful the next time you go to a cinema. These people could be anywhere!! An experience of a friend of my brother's wife left me speechless. Please do send this out to everyone you know. This incident occurred in Bombay's Metro cinema (Among the best in town). They were a group of 6-7 College girls & they went to the theater to see a movie. During the show one of the girls felt a slight pinprick but did not pay much attention to it. After sometime that place began to itch. So she scratched herself and then saw a bit of blood on her hands. She assumed that she had caused it. At the end of the show, her friend noticed a sticker on her dress and read the caption. It read \"Welcome to the world of AIDS\". She tried to pass it off as a practical joke but when she went for a blood test a couple of weeks later (just to be sure), she found herself HIV Positive. When she complained to the cops, they mentioned that her story was one of the many such cases they had received. It seems the operator uses a syringe to transfer a bit of his/her infected blood to the person sitting ahead of him/her. A horrible experience for the victim as also the family & friends. The WORST bit is that the person who does it gains NOTHING where as the victim loses EVERYTHING. So, be careful . . . [Collected on the Internet, 1998] PLEASE CHECK YOUR CHAIRS WHEN GOING TO THE MOVIE THEATRES!!!! An incident occured when a friend's co-worker went to sit in a chair and something was poking her. She then got up and found that it was a needle with a little note at the end. It said, \"Welcome to the real world, you're \"HIV POSITIVE\". Doctors tested the needle and it was HIV POSITIVE. We don't know which theatre this happened at, but it happened in Hawaii. \"BE CAUTIOUS WHEN GOING TO THE MOVIES!\" IF YOU MUST GO TO THE MOVIES, PLEASE, PLEASE CHECK!!!!! One of the safest way is NOT sticking your hands between the seats, but moving the seat part way up and down a few times and REALLY LOOK!!!!!!! Most of us just plop down into the seats. [Collected on the Internet, 2001] PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY! IT MIGHT SAFE YOUR LIFE! This is happening in Montreal. A couple of weeks ago, in a movie theater, a person sat on something sharp in one of the seats. When she stood up to see what it was, a needle was found poking through the seat with an attached note saying, \"You have been infected with HIV.\" The Centers for Disease Control reports similar events have taken place in several other cities recently. All of the needles tested HAVE been positive for HIV. The CDC also reports that needles have been found in the coin return areas of pay phones and soda machines. Everyone is asked to use extreme caution when confronted with these types of situations. All public chairs should be thoroughly but safely inspected prior to any use. A thorough visual inspection is considered a bare minimum. Furthermore, they ask that everyone notify their family members and friends of the potential dangers, as well. Thank you. The previous information was sent from the Regina City Police Department to all of the local governments in the Saskatchewan area and was interdepartmentally dispersed. We were asked to pass this to as many people as possible. This is very important! Just think you could save somebody's life, just by passing this on. Please take a Couple of seconds of your time and pass this on. Thank you for your precious time and consideration!

 [Collected on the Internet, 2002] HIV Warning A few weeks ago in a movie theater in Melbourne a person sat on something that was poking out of one of the seats. When she got up to see what it was she found a needle sticking out of the seat with a note attached saying... \"You have just been infected by HIV\". The Disease Control Centre in Melbourne reports many similar incidents have occurred in many other Australian cities recently. All tested needles ARE HIV Positive. The Centre also reports that needles have been found in the cash dispensers in ATMs. We ask everyone to use extreme caution when faced with this kind of situation. All public chairs/seats should be inspected with vigilance and caution before use. 17 people have been tested positive in the Western suburbs alone in the last 2 months!!! A careful visual inspection should be enough. In addition they ask that each of you pass this message along to all members of your family and your friends of the potential danger. We all have to be careful at public places! This is very important. Just think about saving a life of someone even you don't know by forwarding this message. Please, take a few seconds of your time to pass it along. In all the time since this rumor's initial appearance time we've turned up no confirmed AIDS-laden needle attacks on moviegoers have been reported in Bombay, Hawaii, Dallas, Paris, or anywhere else in the world. We know of only two related incidents, neither of which proved to involve any deliberate intent to infect an innocent victim with HIV: A Louisiana man sat on a needle in a theater in Baton Rouge in December, 1996, and sued the facility over the incident, but there was no note welcoming him to the world of AIDS or any indication of his contracting any infection. An October 2005 report from Athens, Georgia, involved a woman who said she sat upon a needle that had been duct-taped to a movie theater seat, but since then she also has evidenced no symptoms of HIV infection. (In the latter case, although the syringe contained a substance that appeared to be dried blood, it was too small a sample for police to be able to determine what it was or whether it carried a disease.) One of the many versions of this warning claims to be one circulated by the Dallas Police Department. Not only didn't that institution originate the warning, but since its appearance officers there have been kept busy fielding inquiries about this hoax: \"It's all false,\" said Sgt. Jim Chandler, a Dallas police spokesman. \"This has not happened, and we would ask people to stop forwarding this message to their friends because it's creating situations where police departments and emergency personnel are having to respond to inquiries to a situation that has not happened.\" What we have here is an urban legend trading on our fears of catching AIDS. Cautionary tales about hapless bystanders contracting an infectious disease became all the rage in the 1990s. Another such scare has to do with addicts leaving HIV-contaminated needles in the coin returns of pay phones. See our \"Slots of Fun\" page for more about this related legend. This particular pin prick story is a version of the better known \"AIDS Mary\" legend. (In \"AIDS Mary,\" the \"Welcome to the world of AIDS\" communication is typically imparted either through a gift emblazoned with that message being left for the victim or found scrawled in lipstick on the bathroom mirror.) AIDS Mary has been scaring the bejeebers out of us at least since the early 1980s. The pin prick legend, however, isn't all that new either, with the HIV version of it having its roots in an 1989 incident in New York City. The legend in its current incarnation (teenage girls in darkened theaters jabbed with needles) dates back to a much older non-HIV story, one rampant in the New Orleans area in the 1930s. Toothsome young girls were told to beware of Needle Men. Young ladies were strictly instructed to sit at the end of the aisle in moviehouses, not in the middle, lest they attract the attention of white slavers working in pairs who would sit down beside the girl, one on each side, inject her with morphine, and carry her out of the theatre and into a life of shame. The New Orleans Needle Men rumor circulated in another form besides the \"white slavers after young girls\" — others feared these syringe-armed fiends were in fact medical students harvesting cadavers for dissection. Women jabbed by them would quickly succumb to the poison contained in those needles, with their lifeless bodies soon afterwards delivered to a local teaching hospital. Such deadly attacks were said to take place in theaters, but also on the street. Though \"Needle Man\" scares rippled through New Orleans at various times in the 1920s and 1930s, each time sending women into hysterics, there was never any credible reason to believe such men existed. Women weren't disappearing at a furious rate, nor were gals who'd fallen into lives of prostitution afterwards asserting they'd been overcome via injection and abducted. A slightly different yet inexplicably more frightening version of the pin prick legend began circulating in the early spring of 1998. According to it, young people partying in clubs or at raves run the risk of being jabbed with an HIV-loaded needle and then afterwards finding a \"Welcome to reality — you now have AIDS\" message stuffed into a pocket or affixed to them by way of a sticker. This warning has so far circulated in Philadelphia, New York City, San Diego, Oakland, Seattle, Toronto, Vancouver, Montreal, Mexico, Australia, Ecuador, and Germany, each time passed along as something that had already happened to others locally: Do you any of you guys like to go clubbing? Well you might want to think twice after this message. Just in case you don't already know, there is a certain group of people with stickers that say \"Welcome to our world.\" Once this sticker is stuck on you, you contract the AIDS virus because it is filled with tiny needles carrying the infected blood. This has been happening at many dance clubs (even DV8 and Beatbox) and raves. Being cautious is not enough because the person just chooses anyone, and I mean anyone, as his/her victim. So you could just be dancing the night away and not even realize the sticker had been stuck on you. It sounds too demented to be true, but it's the truth. In fact my sister's friend knows someone who just recently contracted the virus in this manner. The world isn't safe anymore. Please pass this on to everyone and anyone you know. Wherever this rumor goes, it has a significant impact on the local bar scene. In August 1998 one popular Toronto nightclub estimated its business to be down by 50%. In March 1998 a popular dance club in San Diego was similarly affected when the story swept through there. People hear this story and stay away in droves. Police in each of these cities have investigated the rumors and found nothing. The clubs named in the rumors similarly report they know nothing of any attacks. Okay, so this isn't happening in movie houses, at popular dance clubs or at raves. Where did this HIV-loaded needle story come from? Keep in mind that although there have at various times been random attacks with needles, none have resulted in infection being passed to victims. That part is myth. Now for the truth of it: For a few weeks in the fall of 1989, a group of Black teenagers (mostly girls) scared the pants off the denizens of New York City by running about jabbing pins into the necks of 41 random white females. Media coverage escalated the general public's fears as it was repeatedly stated the pins were tainted with AIDS. Within a week the kids responsible were found and arrested, and it was at that time police discovered there was no basis to the reports of the AIDS virus being part of these attacks. The hooligans responsible admitted it was just a fun game to them, run up to a white woman, stick her with a pin, see her reaction, then run off. Possibly inspired by the 1989 panic in New York City, for three weeks in 1990 a Black man terrorized white and hispanic women in that city by hitting them in the legs and buttocks with dart-like missiles fired from a homemade blowgun. More than 50 women were hit in this fashion before the man responsible was caught. When asked why the attacks, the assailant made a rambling statement to the effect that short skirts were immoral and \"people from the islands shoot women who wear provocative clothing with darts to punish them ... they also throw them sometimes into volcanoes.\" (Good thing this nut didn't live in Las Vegas, else the volcano at the Mirage would have been standing room only.) Kids have since gotten the idea this is a cool game to play. In 1995 a 13-year-old boy brought a hypodermic syringe to Mount Pleasant Area Secondary School (Pennsylvania) and proceeded to jab 28 classmates with it. The boy was charged with aggravated assault, simple assault, reckless endangerment and possession of a weapon on school property and was turned over to juvenile authorities pending a hearing. In 1997 two teenage lads at Exeter-West Greenwich (Rhode Island) jabbed 32 other students with a medical lancet. Meant to be a \"playful prank\" (stabbing someone with anything isn't considered playful in my book), the state Health Department took the matter very seriously, ordering blood tests and vaccinations against Hepatitis B for all the victims. The boys responsible were suspended and criminal charges were brought against them. Earlier in 1997, 18 Lecanto Middle School (Florida) pupils were attacked by five schoolmates wielding lancets. The perpetrators were suspended for ten days and medical tests were run on their victims. Again, it was only a meanspirited prank — no viruses were communicated in the attacks. Robberies have been carried out by syringe-wielding robbers who claim to be armed with the AIDS virus and willing to stick anyone who gets in their way with the infected needle. It has to be stressed that though various robbers and muggers have claimed to have been so armed, thus far this has never proved out to be anything more than an empty threat. All syringes so employed have tested out as perfectly clean. Even so, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to see that claiming to be armed with an AIDS-tainted needle would generate a lot of cooperation from the people you're trying to rob. Expect to see this \"weapon\" become even more common as time marches on. It's not all sweetness and light, however. On 20 May 1999, WBFF/WNUV of Baltimore, Maryland, reported on a midday attack upon an unnamed Towson, Maryland, woman. She had been checking her oil at a gas station when she was approached by a man who asked her for money. The victim described what happened next: I said I didn't have any money. I said I only had a dollar. He said that would do. He put one arm around me and kissed my cheek, he put another arm around me and stabbed me with a needle, and said welcome to reality you have HIV. The victim's description led police to a panhandler known to frequent the area. He was found with a syringe on him. (Click here to read WBFF's report about this incident.) In January 2000, the attacker earned a three-year prison sentence for his crime. The victim is not HIV-positive. There has been at least one verified HIV-positive syringe attack of the non-random variety. It happened in Australia in 1990, with the victim being a prison guard at Sydney's Long Bay Jail. Gary Pearce opened a security gate for an inmate known to be HIV-positive and in doing so turned his back for a second. He felt a jab in his buttock. He turned to knock a blood-filled syringe away just as the inmate, Graham Farlow, shouted \"AIDS\" and ran off. Pearce rushed to a nearby office where the wound was sterilised. To no avail however. Despite the 1-in-200 chance that a stick injury from an HIV-infected needle would produce a positive result, he tested HIV positive two months after the attack. Pearce died on 30 August 1997 of an AIDS-related illness. Farlow had died in 1991. This attack plus a spate of supposedly HIV-loaded needle robberies (the robberies at needlepoint were real, but the HIV part was never proved), prompted the Australian government to introduce legislation covering such offenses. Since the victim didn't die within a year and a day of the pricking, the attacker couldn't be charged with murder under the old laws. That changed in 1990. Now robbers using syringes filled with HIV-infected blood as weapons face up to 25 years in jail in New South Wales state. British police would like to have something a lot closer to what the Australian legal system provides for. In 1994 they unsuccessfully called for a crackdown on HIV-loaded needle threats, claiming the harm done to victims necessitated both harsher penalties than currently legally available and voicing the need to be able to charge someone in possession of a syringe with carrying an offensive weapon. At present, the psychological damage caused by the threat to inject someone with an HIV-infected syringe is classed in Britain as actual bodily harm, and an attacker can be charged with grievous bodily harm if an injury is sustained. Is that really enough, or are the British police right that this doesn't go far enough? The AIDS pinprick legend's popularity stems from our fear of contracting AIDS. Even if we take pains to avoid engaging in high risk activities or strive to do so in as safe a fashion as possible, we're all too aware we're still vulnerable, and this legend speaks to that awareness. Though in the early days of this disease, the average citizen felt perfectly safe from its ravages, AIDS is now no longer perceived as something only other people will catch. It's now seen as a danger to all of us. This sense of being at risk, coupled with ongoing fears of the madmen who walk among us, has given birth to this bit of scarelore. Credibility is further supplied by news stories about kids jokingly stabbing classmates with needles and robbers threatening victims with \"loaded\" syringes. Mix a bit of truth into an existing bit of scarelore, and it becomes powerful medicine indeed. The typical college girl victim is a metaphor for us. By casting the one pinpricked as one of tender years, the undeserving nature of the victim is underscored. She's seen as both young and untouched by the world, therefore completely undeserving of this terrible fate. (As, by implication, are we.) Her gender also comes into play as \"college girl\" is a shortform in the world of urban legends for sexual and social innocence. Her fatal infection is made to appear doubly tragic in that it doesn't seem to us, the audience, she would otherwise have come in contact with this illness. Indeed, no more \"innocent\" a mythical victim could be created. She's a lot like us, in other words. The terrifying aspect of this bit of scarelore is we see ourselves in her place. <!--
Additional information: In March 2008, police reported that someone had been embedding used hypodermic needles in park benches in New Waterford, Nova Scotia, but there was as yet no determination whether the needles posed any risk of spreading infectious diseases. In February 2009, three people in Vancouver, Washington, were pricked by syringes taped in public places, one to the handset of a pay phone, two to doorknobs.

"Barbara Mikkelson" 1997-11-02 "The charred remains of a scuba diver were discovered in a tree after a forest fire." "The tragic tale of the unfortunately scooped diver has been with us at least since 1987: Fire Authorities in California found a corpse in a burnt out section of forest whilst assessing the damage done by a forest fire. The deceased male was dressed in a full wetsuit, complete with a dive tank, flippers and face mask. A post mortem examination revealed that the person died not from burns but from massive internal injuries. Dental records provided a positive identification. Investigators then set about determining how a fully clad diver ended up in the middle of a forest fire. It was revealed that, on the day of the fire, the person went for a diving trip off the coast — some 20 kilometers away from the forest. The firefighters, seeking to control the fire as quickly as possible, called in a fleet of helicopters with very large buckets. The buckets were dropped into the ocean for rapid filling, then flown to the forest fire and emptied. You guessed it. One minute our diver was making like Flipper in the Pacific, the next he was doing a breaststroke in a fire bucket 300m in the air. Apparently, he extinguished exactly 1.78m (5'10\") of the fire. Told at various times as having happened in California or France, to date there's not been so much as one charred scuba diver recovered from the aftermath of a forest fire in either location. (You'll also sometimes hear of a fisherman found in a tree, still determinedly clutching his fishing pole even in his extra-crispy state of final repose. None of them has been found, either.) Which is not too surprising — the technology governing both bucket- and scoop-style water bombers rules out anyone being taken up with a load of water. The intake of the largest helibucket is a one-foot ring. Although thousands of gallons of water can be carried in the largest \"bambi bucket,\" it all gets in there through that one-foot opening, an aperture far too minuscule for even a small person to be pulled through, let alone a typical-sized man dressed in scuba gear. Bombardier water bombers typically have two intakes, but both are 4 inches by 10 inches, far too small to get a diver through. Further, these intakes are protected by grilles. Helitankers (choppers bearing a fixed tank) suck up water through a hose known as a \"donkey dick.\" The opening to this hose is only a couple of inches in diameter. Though it's impossible to be scooped or sucked up into a water bomber, there has been at least one injury to a swimmer resulting from coming too near to one while it was in the process of reloading. In 1998, a swimmer in Corsica was caught in eddies caused by a Canadair and thrown against a landing stage. She suffered a bruised leg. It's been suggested the legend's origin lies in a collection of \"how did this person die?\" puzzles, this particular one presented as \"The charred body of a scuba diver was found high in a tree after a forest fire — how did he get there?\" Hypothetical stories have a way of being later remembered as real occurrences, and that likely could have happened here. (Visit the Ronald Opus page for an example of this sort of transmutation.) The appeal of this legend lies in a combination of a few factors: Scuba divers are repeatedly asked about this tall tale. Their ongoing annoyance with this question — How many times can one say \"No, it never happened\" without losing patience? — inspired one to invent the tongue-in-cheek sport of \"Fire Diving\". Those unfamiliar with the pastime will want to visit his Fire Diving page. Sightings: Look for mention of this urban legend early in the 1999 film Magnolia. Also, the 1997 Mordecai Richler novel Barney's Version and the 1989 Peter Mayle novel A Year in Provence make use of the legend. An episode of CBS's CSI: Crime Scene Investigation (\"Scuba Doobie-Doo,\" original air date 25 October 2001) was based on this legend. https://web.archive.org/web/20020205165329/https://www.angelfire.com/wa2/rosadebon/deb_scuba.htm" 1997 "Nov" 11 1980

"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/crushin-roulette/" "legend" "Beep, beep. Crushed punch buggy." "David Mikkelson" 1997-09-02 "Two large trucks that had collided head-on are pulled apart weeks later, revealing that a Volkswagen Beetle and its occupants had been crushed between them." "We collected this story from the internet in 1997: Two of those big huge 18-wheelers were involved in a collision at very high speeds; one tail-ended the other one really really hard, so hard that the two trucks were basically fused together. The proper authorities dragged the trucks (still connected) to wherever it is they take them, I guess a junkyard, and then just left them there until someone could figure out what to do with them. After a few days, a stench started to emanate from the wreckage, and no one knew what it was. It got worse each day. When they finally pulled the two trucks apart, they found that a VW Bug, its passengers still inside, had gotten smashed between the trucks during the accident. A ritual familiar to high school students in California and other states is the taking of Driver's Education (or \"Driver's Ed\" for short): A classroom-based course intended to prepare teenagers for the tasks of undertaking on-the-road driving lessons, acquiring their driver's licenses, and becoming safe and responsible motorists. Such courses have typically included a mixture of instruction in traffic laws and regulations, training with driving simulators, and the viewing of \"safety\" films such as Mechanized Death, Wheels of Tragedy, and Red Asphalt, the last of them described by the Los Angeles Times as follows: \"Red Asphalt\" — the title says it all — is the flip side of California's carefree car culture. Intended to scare the bejabbers out of fresh-faced and obliviously immortal teen drivers, the original film and its four remakes are horror shows of vehicular ultraviolence mostly filmed by camera-ready cops called to accident scenes along the state's roads. The gruesome road-splatter films have become sociological touchstones for many drivers, and even may be among the most-viewed movie titles ever to come out of California. The \"crushed Beetle\" example quoted above is akin to an oral Red Asphalt tableau, with true horror apparent only in retrospect: Two 18-wheelers that collided head-on have become fused together as a result and are removed from the accident scene in that state; not until they are pulled apart at a wreckage yard days (or weeks) later does someone discover that a Volkswagen Beetle — with its dead driver and occupants still inside — had been crushed between them. In one sense, this legend might be read as merely a general warning on the potential dangers associated with driving, with the inclusion of the largest and smallest vehicles then commonly found on roadways (i.e., tractor-trailers and a VW Beetle) used to heighten the horrific effect and make the plot device of delayed discovery plausible. On the other hand, this legend might be interpreted as a commentary on our industrial society: You, dear individual commuter, in your small, cheap vehicle, are of little importance compared to the big rigs that transport the raw materials and finished goods which keep our economy running; you're just collateral damage that we have to clean up if and when we get around to finding you. In December 2008, a confluence of traffic accidents on an Ohio roadway led to an incident reminiscent of this legend: A man who was killed in a car crash was left dead in the crumpled vehicle when it was towed away, and the body was not discovered until family members found it two days later. Emil Azzam died instantly from head and neck injuries when his car crashed on a snowy roadway. The car was not far from a multivehicle accident, and witnesses had described Azzam's car as an abandoned vehicle. Dennis Allen, co-owner of Parma Towing, said the company was asked to perform an emergency tow so the road could be cleared. He wouldn't say if the driver looked in the car before it was towed. Azzam's family filed a missing person's report, traced his vehicle to the impounded car lot and found the body. He was still holding a burned-out cigarette in his hand, his family said." 1997 "Sep" 9 1990

 [Marsano, 1987] Somewhere in California, a young woman decided to fit herself out with a sexy pair of skintight jeans. Having bought the tightest pair she could find, she went further, using the traditional technique of immersing herself in a tub of water and allowing the jeans to dry and shrink on her body. The jeans shrank tight enough to bring her blood circulation to a total stop.  Variations:
 <IMG HSPACE=16 VSPACE=16 WIDTH=121 HEIGHT=225 ALT=\"Jeans\" SRC=\"https://www.snopes.com/uploads/images/horrors/graphics/jeans.gif\" ALIGN=RIGHT BORDER=0> versions of the legend end not with the wearer's death, but with the embarrassment of the wearer's having to be cut out of the jeans by an emergency rescue crew.  Origins: This legend originated in the mid-1980s, not long after Levi's initiated its new line of shrink-to-fit jeans with a commercial featuring a \"hot, sweaty young man [who] steps into a bath wearing only his Levi's 501s and soaks them until they perfectly fit his lower half.\" The leap from television commercial to legend is an obvious one, with a gender switch to enhance the vanity aspect. (Although the legend features both men and women in the starring role, the latter predominate.) Last updated: 19 May 2011

"Claim: A golfer in the habit of carrying his tee in his mouth while playing holes grows sicker and sicker over the course of a few days and then drops dead. A post-mortem reveals that the golfer had ingested a lethal dose of the pesticide sprayed on the golf course. Status: True. Origins: Although a few of the details have been changed, this legend is based on real-life incident. In  1982, Navy Lieutenant George M.Prior, 30, played 36 holes of golf at the Army-Navy Country Club in Arlington, VA. Even before the last hole Prior was complaining of a headache; by nightfall he was feverish and nauseated and had developed a rash. Four days later Prior was in Bethesda Naval Hospital with a 104.5 degree fever, his body covered with blisters. He died ten days later after a toxic substance had burned the skin from 80% of his body and caused his major organs to fail. The toxic substance was determined to be Daconil, an FDA-approved fungicide that had been sprayed on the Army-Navy golf course twice a week. Prior apparently had a hypersensitivity to the chemical used in the fungicide, causing a severe allergic reaction. His widow filed a $20 million lawsuit against the manufacturer, Diamond Shamrock Chemical Company; the lawsuit was eventually settled out of court. Last updated: 2 September 2006

"Claim: A runaway truck careering down a steep hill turns off onto an emergency exit ramp, only to run a over a picnicking family who had mistaken the safety ramp for a rest stop. LEGEND Example: [Brunvand, 1993]   Scattered all through this part of the hills are short uphill safety ramps where a truck with failed brakes can
roll in for an emergency stop. One day a truckie was just approaching Eagle on the Hill, a couple of miles above The Devil's Elbow, when he lost his brakes. It's a busy road, and he had a full load on board. Unable to slow down, he careered along, flashing his lights and blaring the horn, swerving all over the road as he wrestled with the truck. Miraculously, he kept on the road, and cars cleared out of his way. If he could keep the truck upright and get around The Devil's Elbow, there was a safety ramp a few hundred yards beyond. By a miracle, he made it around the bend without rolling over, and turned the speeding truck off onto the safety ramp. There, halfway up, was a family having a picnic.
 Origins: The age and origins of this legend are unknown, but it has analogs in similar stories wherein tragedies are narrowly averted, only to followed by even larger catastrophes. Last updated: 14 April 2011
