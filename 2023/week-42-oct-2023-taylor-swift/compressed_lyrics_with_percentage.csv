All Too Well (10 Minute Version) [Taylor's Version] [From The Vault],"I walked through the door with you, the air was cold But something 'bout it felt like home somehow And I left my scarf there at your sister's house And you've still got it in your drawer, even now Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place And I can picture it after all these days And I know it's long gone and That magic's not here no more And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all Oh, oh, oh 'Cause there we are again on that little town street You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me Wind in my hair, I was there I remember it all too well Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team You taught me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me And you were tossing me the car keys, ""fuck the patriarchy"" Key chain on the ground, we were always skipping town And I was thinking on the drive down, any time now He's gonna say it's love, you never called it what it was 'Til we were dead and gone and buried Check the pulse and come back swearing it's the same After three months in the grave And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame And I know it's long gone and There was nothing else I could do And I forget about you long enough To forget why I needed to 'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night We're dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light Down the stairs, I was there I remember it all too well And there we are again when nobody had to know You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath Sacred prayer and we'd swear To remember it all too well, yeah Well, maybe we got lost in translation Maybe I asked for too much But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'Til you tore it all up Running scared, I was there I remember it all too well And you call me up again just to break me like a promise So casually cruel in the name of being honest I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here 'Cause I remember it all, all, all They say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new Hell Every time you double-cross my mind You said if we had been closer in age maybe it would have been fine And that made me want to die The idea you had of me, who was she? A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you Not weeping in a party bathroom Some actress asking me what happened, you That's what happened, you You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes Sipping coffee like you're on a late-night show But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willing you to come And he said, ""It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one"" Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone But you keep my old scarf from that very first week 'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me You can't get rid of it 'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah 'Cause there we are again when I loved you so Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known It was rare, I was there I remember it all too well Wind in my hair, you were there You remember it all Down the stairs, you were there You remember it all It was rare, I was there I remember it all too well And I was never good at telling jokes, but the punch line goes I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue? Just between us, did the love affair maim you, too? 'Cause in this city's barren cold I still remember the first fall of snow And how it glistened as it fell I remember it all too well Just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well? Just between us, do you remember it all too well? Just between us, I remember it (Just between us), all too well Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there Down the stairs, I was there, I was there Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there It was rare, you remember it all too well Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there Down the stairs, I was there, I was there Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there It was rare, you remember it Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there Down the stairs, I was there, I was there Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there It was rare, you remember it Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there Down the stairs, I was

All Too Well (Taylor's Version),"I walked through the door with you, the air was cold But something 'bout it felt like home somehow And I left my scarf there at your sister's house And you've still got it in your drawer, even now Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place And I can picture it after all these days And I know it's long gone and That magic's not here no more And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all Oh, oh, oh 'Cause there we are again on that little town street You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me Wind in my hair, I was there I remember it all too well Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team You tell me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me And I know it's long gone and There was nothing else I could do And I forget about you long enough To forget why I needed to 'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night We're dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light Down the stairs, I was there I remember it all too well, yeah And maybe we got lost in translation Maybe I asked for too much But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'Til you tore it all up Running scared, I was there I remember it all too well And you call me up again Just to break me like a promise So casually cruel in the name of being honest I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here 'Cause I remember it all, all, all Too well Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone But you keep my old scarf from that very first week 'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me You can't get rid of it 'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah 'Cause there we are again when I loved you so Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known It was rare, I was there I remember it all too well Wind in my hair, you were there You remember it all Down the stairs, you were there You remember it all It was rare, I was there I remember it all too

'Cross the room your silhouette Starts to make its way to me The playful conversation starts Counter all your quick remarks Like passing notes in secrecy And it was enchanting to meet you All I can say is, I was enchanted to meet you This night is sparkling Don't you let it go I'm wonderstruck Blushing all the way home I'll spend forever Wondering if you knew I was enchanted to meet you The lingering question kept me up 2AM, who do you love? I wonder 'til I'm wide awake And now I'm pacing back and forth Wishing you were at my door I'd open up and you would say, ""Hey"" It was enchanting to meet you All I know is I was enchanted to meet you This night is sparkling Don't you let it go I'm wonderstruck Blushing all the way home I'll spend forever Wondering if you knew This night is flawless Don't you let it go I'm wonderstruck Dancing around all alone I'll spend forever Wondering if you knew I was enchanted to meet you This is me praying that This was the very first page Not where the storyline ends My thoughts will echo your name Until I see you again These are the words I held back As I was leaving too soon I was enchanted to meet you Please don't be in love With someone else Please don't have somebody Waiting on you Please don't be in love (Ooh) With someone else Please don't have somebody (Ooh, hey) Waiting on you This night is sparkling Don't you let it go I'm wonderstruck Blushing all the way home I'll spend forever Wondering if you knew This night is flawless (Please don't be in love with someone else) Don't you let it go I'm wonderstruck (Please don't have somebody waiting on you) Dancing around all alone I'll spend forever (Please don't be in love with someone else) Wondering if you knew I was enchanted to meet you Please don't be in love With someone else Please don't have somebody Waiting on you","b'x\x9c\xcdT\xd1j\x1b1\x10\xfc\x95%/\x8e\xc1O\xfd\x81\xe0&\x94\x1a\x9a\xb6\x90\xb4\xa1\x8f\x9b\xbb=KX\xd6^$\x9d\x8f\xfb\xfb\xce\xeaZHR\xea\xc6\x90B\xc0\x0f\xb6\xbc\x9a\x99\x9d\x9d\xd5\xad\x93$\xb4\xa1\x913\xf1\x96}\xa4\xa2\xd1o]\xa1\x0f\x9a\x1a\x1f\xb7\x14x\xc0OI+\xeaxg\x07y\xef\x83d\xba\xe1\xbd\x90\x86\x96\x8aO\xd2\xae(h\x940Q\x1f\xb8\x11\xba\xe3\x102iG>f\x1f\x1bI\xbeL+\xca\xcew\xc5 d\x02\x00\xc7\x96\x0e\xdcpl&\xfa\xce\xd1g\'-\x8dN""\xe4d\x1ei\xd2!\x81\x13h\xeb\x10p\x86J\x9cO\xe4\xf3\x8a|\xa9\x8a%6\x8ec\x85,J{\x91b\xb7\xe8\x87\xdd\xac\x1c\xa3\xf3\xb9\x97\xaa\xef\xec#\x1f\x84FAY\xb98\xa3\xc5e\xd2\x9c\xa98\xa1\xa4\xba\x9f\xd9\xb2\x0fN\x07)E\xe8\xa6p*\xb9\xc2\xf2N@\x080\x90W\x1a\xba\xc5-4:uC\xa0F\xe3AR\xe6\xe2\x15\xfa\xe6[\x97:DXFpa\x06~\x18|\xb3\xa3${N\xbbL\x9f<\x10{\xce\xd9\x84G-\x10\n\xe3\xb34I\xe0\xc5\x1a\xbe\x1c\xef\xefO?6\x8f\xcba\xe3\xe3\xea[x@\xf3L\xf1%\xf7\x90\x10\x0c\xf1J\xe3b\xae\x08\xa8\x04\xe3Vi\xb3\xd8\xd3\xa8\xb1EC%\r\x90\xfc>\x0c\x98\x1a\xaa\xad\x153\xcbLp\n\x0f6\x0b\x9c\xc0\\\xa8\xed4\t<\xa0\xbbz\xd3\xaa}W\x81wQ\xc6\x7fh\x1321\xf3\xad\x87Ar\xb5q\'}1\x9f\x87\x9e\xde\xad\xafW\x18\xa3R\xab\xb3V=\xc8\x85aV.Z\x14\x1ff\xd5\xbe\x15\xe2\xd1fe\x06F\x1d\xebq\xcf5\xc4\xf7\x8c^x\x96Z\x1c\xdd\xf9\xb9)\x03\x1cm\x01\x18t\x13(4\xe1VK\x8a\xb6\x8c\xdcn\xd4\x1a\x1d\x10t\x98m1\x92\xe9\x8c6/\x98\xcf\xce4\xc0\xf1\xb7<\x9b\xa7\xfc]\xe0\x11\xab\x9d_F\x7f\x85\xcd\xad\xec\tio\xab\x08\xb6G\xe0\xb5\x92\x01A\xf8\xa0\x9b>\xf1T-v\x18S=\xb7k\xd60\xa0\'\xea<\x14a\xd0[\xa1\xcfZ\xec\x05\xc1@\xed\xdf\\4M\xb0S@\xd1f\xba\xc6\xf6b\xbb\xd1+\x00<$J\xe3t^\xcfho\xd9\xb7X\xb3\x84=\x94\xaa`~\x0e\x91\xd0\x8c|\xfc\x82\x1c5\xb56Q\'\xc8C\r\xd5\xfa\xf7\x80\x83\xf0a\x0e\x82RV\x8dG\xbb\xfb\x8aj\xc0\xb6\xd5\xe7{\xb1\xf5\xb7`#\x98Hg\xc6\x08\xcdG\t(yR\xe9\xec\t\xb3\xbf\xef\xb5\x9d\xf0\xc8\xfa\x1a=p\x1d\xc3<\xff\xa2ny\x1a\xb2]Y\xa1\xc9i\xf9\x9c\xe4\x8d\x06\xf6\xfco\xcd\x8f\xcf\xdb^\xbeL\xea\xf9\x11w\xc6\'\x96,OZ\x84S\x84\x9e\xbe4\xff!V?\x01O\xc5\xe2S'",2081,686,1395,67.03507928880346

I Bet You Think About Me (Taylor's Version) [From The Vault],"3 AM and I'm still awake, I'll bet you're just fine Fast asleep in your city that's better than mine And the girl in your bed has a fine pedigree And I'll bet your friends tell you she's better than me, huh Well, I tried to fit in with your upper-crust circles Yeah, they let me sit in back when we were in love Oh, they sit around talkin' about the meaning of life And the book that just saved 'em that I hadn't heard of But now that we're done and it's over I bet you couldn't believe When you realized I'm harder to forget than I was to leave And I bet you think about me You grew up in a silver-spoon gated community Glamorous, shiny, bright Beverly Hills I was raised on a farm, no, it wasn't a mansion Just livin' room dancin' and kitchen table bills But you know what they say, you can't help who you fall for And you and I fell like an early spring snow But reality crept in, you said we're too different You laughed at my dreams, rolled your eyes at my jokes Mr. Superior Thinkin' Do you have all the space that you need?

Love Story (Taylor's Version),"We were both young when I first saw you I close my eyes and the flashback starts I'm standing there On a balcony in summer air See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns See you make your way through the crowd And say, ""Hello"" Little did I know That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet"" And I was crying on the staircase Begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes"" So I sneak out to the garden to see you We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew So close your eyes Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh 'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet"" But you were everything to me I was begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes"" Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel This love is difficult, but it's real Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes"" Oh, oh And I got tired of waiting Wondering if you were ever coming around My faith in you was fading When I met you on the outskirts of town And I said, ""Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone I keep waiting for you, but you never come Is this in my head? I don't know what to think"" He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said ""Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone I love you and that's all I really know I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress It's a love story, baby, just say, 'Yes'"" Oh, oh, oh Oh, oh, oh 'Cause we were both young when I first saw you","b'x\x9c\xddU\xcbn\xdb0\x10\xfc\x95\x85/\xba\xf8\x1f\x8a\xa4-\x10\x17\rZ4\x05\x82\x1eW\xd2\xcabE\x91.IE\xd0\xdfwv)7}\\\x92k\x0f\xb6I\x99\x1c\xce\xce\xccR\x8fB\xab$\xa16\x96\x91\xb6\xb8\x843\xad\xa3\x04:\xd1\xe0R.\x94y\xd5\xc7\x98w>f\xa1y#\xd9$\x13\x87\x9e\xca(4x\xcec\xcb\xddD\xb9p*\x99N\xcd\xac\xc3\xd0;@a\x05\xb0?\x05bj\xd9w1l\xe4\x02\xe5e\x9e%\x11\xbbD\x0f""\x06\xe3\xddy,\xf9Hy\x9f_\x80\xb5\x1dm\x88\x8d\x9e\xceq\r\xd9V+\x99\x99\'\x1b$Zy\xc3\xa2\x14\x97\xf3h\x8b\xbb\x14\xd7\x9en@.3\xf6\x1f\xee\xc4\xfbx\xa0\x8f\xae\x14/\xd4\xbb\x1e\x85L!\xae\xf4u\xe4bXV\xfd\x978K<>\xcf\x15r\xd5\x02.\xd2\xb6\x1e\xe5*""J\xef\xb9\xef7@\xbb\x1e\xd8\x0f\x05\x87\xb32\x18R\x9c\xe9\xc3\xe2\x9d\x94\x83-=\x81X\x06\x99M1b0j\x10\xc5\xa5\x8e\xa1\xe1\xad\x9c\xcf\xfa\x07\x8e\x03\xccg/\xfa\xb0\x8f\xa1)\xa8\xf3x0mOv\xca\x95X\xd1\x82g``\xba\x9a\xa6+j\xe5@\xad\x10\xfb\x18\x04\xb2C%\xccVv\x05\xd8GR\xd5L\xfe&\x93\x97\xa1P\x898\x83\\\xa6\xb4\x04\xfa\x16\x97}\x83\xa9\x9d\\\xe8\xa4\x9e\xfb\xcf\xe3\x0cO\x0b@\x98||\xd22b\x82\xb2-\xb7\xf8\xfe\xbeXDT\xe9o\x92\x0f\xf4\x10\x95x\x10\x9e(.v\xa4\xe2\x9c9\xf5\x88\x14fy7\xf0Qh\x12\xb9\xd0\x8f\x05\x92Q\xd3\xf1\x92\xb5\xa4\x06\x85\xf5\xc2=\xb9A7n\xb0JV\x05\xad\xd93\xc7-}\xefs\xc7\x17%\x89r\n\xa2ACLJ\xb0\xda\xbc\x8e\xce\xcb\x91\xe2\xa8\x1fj\xde\x1a\xfa\xdf^W\x8b\x98\x80\x94<H\xe0S\x10\xcaW\x18}\xbb\xfc\x96 y\x92\xb4\x81\x8f\x86>\xaaU\x15\xbf\xfdo\xad\xde\xe9f~R\xba\xd6\xaa\x9b\xfaWj\xe8\xd5z\xf4\x9eV2\xa2\xdd0\x1dD<\xda\x0e\xac\x0c\x1c\xbf\xbd\x1b\x06\xd7-\xbe\xe0\x0ch\xe9\xf4\xe8$\xec\xe9\x9d\t\xa4\x05\x0f\xc9,@4\x14K\xa5q\xc5\xa2\x15\x87\xea\xfe\xfc*\xd2\x9fj$j\x8b\x9e#\x94rIz\x05\xdb\xc5\xa4\xc7\x18zI:B\x06\xffp\x97\xba8\xebs\xc6m\x83\xfd\xf7H\x03\xf6\x8cz\xa1\xd9:\xb8=\xb0\xddz\x8f\xf5\x02\x9d\xa5\xe6c\xef\x7f\xb0\xce\x93\xd3+R\xb9kho~\x99\x0f~\x7f\xebyj0h\x05H*\x9c\xc2\xe6x\r@m\x9e+e\xcd\xbe\xe5\xab\xdd\x03\x19\xaet\xb14W\x99@\x12\xa9\x1e\xd1[o\xb0\xbd\x06\xd0\xee\xc1U\xefA\xebS\x17\xa6\x03\xdd\x89\xf6\x9c\x7fn\xddZ\xac\xc6\xe5\xb2x\xafZ\xe1\x10\xa6T\x83g\xf7,\xb2{\xb8\xe7\x946\xe3]\xbb\xc3\xeeR\xf5\xacr\x19\xb5*@>g\xb8\x9a\xa5l\xeb\x9b\x84\xcdBl8Y\x04\xfcV\xe9\x9d\xd0\x0f~\xc2\xb1\xd8l\xed\x8f\xc6<\xc29\xba\xb8n\xda\xb9\xa0\xdd\x0b\x9a*\xbd0\t\r\x92\xd0\\\xa3`q\xf8m\xb8_\x16\xeb\xcb\xde\x8a?\x01\x97\xd6{\xf4'",1853,779,1074,57.9600647598489

You put your arm around me for the first time You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter You are the best thing that's ever been mine Flash forward, and we're taking on the world together And there's a drawer of my things at your place You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes But we got bills to pay We got nothing figured out When it was hard to take Yes, yes This is what I thought about: Do you remember, we were sitting there, by the water? You put your arm around me for the first time You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter You are the best thing that's ever been mine Do you remember all the city lights on the water?

Nothing New (Taylor's Version) [From The Vault],"They tell you while you're young ""Girls, go out and have your fun"" Then they hunt and slay the ones who actually do it Criticize the way you fly When you're soaring through the sky Shoot you down and then they sigh And say, ""She looks like she's been through it"" Lord, what will become of me Once I've lost my novelty? I've had too much to drink tonight And I know it's sad but this is what I think about And I wake up in the middle of the night It's like I can feel time moving How can a person know everything at eighteen But nothing at twenty-two? And will you still want me when I'm nothing new? How long will it be cute, all this crying in my room? When you can't blame it on my youth And roll your eyes with affection And my cheeks are growing tired From turning red and faking smiles Are we only buying time 'til I lose your attention And someone else lights up the room? People love an ingénue I've had too much to drink tonight How did I go from growing up to breaking down? And I wake up in the middle of the night It's like I can feel time moving How can a person know everything at eighteen But nothing at twenty-two? And will you still want me when I'm nothing new?

I'd tell you I miss you, but I don't know how I've never heard silence quite this loud Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room And we're not speaking And I'm dying to know Is it killing you like it's killing me?

Did I close my fist around something delicate? Did I shatter you? And I'm sitting on a bench in Coney Island Wondering where did my baby go? The fast times, the bright lights, the merry go Sorry for not making you my centerfold Over and over Lost again with no surprises Disappointments, close your eyes And it gets colder and colder When the sun goes down The question pounds my head What's a lifetime of achievement If I pushed you to the edge? But you were too polite to leave me And do you miss the rogue Who coaxed you into paradise and left you there? Will you forgive my soul When you're too wise to trust me and too old to care? 'Cause we were like the mall before the internet It was the one place to be The mischief, the gift-wrapped suburban dreams Sorry for not winning you an arcade ring Over and over Lost again with no surprises Disappointments, close your eyes And it gets colder and colder When the sun goes down Were you waiting at our old spot In the tree line By the gold clock Did I leave you hanging every single day?
